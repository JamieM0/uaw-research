## 2. CUSTOM TYPE: LEVAIN_CULTURE

### OBJECT: mother_starter
```
ID: levain_mother_starter
Type: levain_culture
Name: Mother Starter (Sourdough Culture)
Emoji: ü´ô

Properties:
- culture_id: "mother_starter_main" (string, unique identifier)
- culture_type: "mother" (string, indicates this is the perpetual starter)
- health: 95 (0-100 scale, current vitality, affects fermentation reliability)
- activity_level: "peak" (enum: ["dormant", "rising", "peak", "falling", "sluggish"], current fermentation state)
- weight_g: 600 (grams, numeric, current total mass)
- hydration_percent: 100 (percentage, numeric, equal parts flour and water by weight)
- last_fed_timestamp: null (ISO timestamp, when last feeding occurred)
- next_feeding_due_timestamp: null (ISO timestamp, when next feeding should occur)
- feeding_interval_hours: 10 (hours, numeric, typical time between feedings)
- temperature_current_f: 38 (degrees Fahrenheit, numeric, current storage temp)
- temperature_optimal_storage_f: 38 (degrees F, numeric, cold storage ideal)

- aroma: "pleasant_tangy" (enum: ["pleasant_tangy", "vinegary", "acetone", "neutral"], indicates health)
- flour_composition: {"bread_flour_organic": 0.85, "whole_wheat_organic": 0.15} (object, ratios by type)
- age_days: 912 (days, numeric, how long starter has been maintained, 2.5 years)
- discard_amount_per_feeding_g: 200 (grams, numeric, removed before feeding)
- feeding_flour_amount_g: 200 (grams, numeric, added during feeding)
- feeding_water_amount_g: 200 (grams, numeric, added during feeding)
- feeding_water_temp_target_f: 80 (degrees F, numeric, warm water accelerates fermentation)
- state: "healthy" (enum: ["healthy", "weak", "contaminated", "dead"], overall condition)
- contamination_risk: 0.01 (0-1 probability, chance of spoilage per day without feeding)
- can_be_used_for_production: true (boolean, quality gate)
- backup_culture_exists: true (boolean, indicates redundancy)

Rationale: The mother starter is the biological foundation of all sourdough production. Its health directly impacts every sourdough loaf. The activity_level and health properties drive fermentation timing - a weak starter creates cascade delays. Temperature tracking is critical because fermentation speed is exponentially temperature-dependent. The age property reflects that this is an established, stable culture (not a new, unpredictable one).

### OBJECT: production_levain_tuesday
```
ID: levain_production_tuesday
Type: levain_culture
Name: Production Levain (Tuesday Build)
Emoji: ü´ô

Properties:
- culture_id: "production_levain_tuesday_20251022" (string, unique per build with date)
- culture_type: "production" (string, indicates this is a one-time build for specific day)

- aroma: "neutral_yeasty" (enum, changes as ferments)
- flour_composition: {"bread_flour_organic": 0.85, "whole_wheat_organic": 0.15} (object, ratios)
- mother_starter_amount_used_g: 500 (grams, numeric, how much mother went into this)
- flour_added_g: 2000 (grams, numeric)
- water_added_g: 2000 (grams, numeric)
- state: "building" (enum: ["building", "peak", "past_peak", "unusable"], fermentation state)
- peak_duration_window_hours: 2 (hours, numeric, how long it stays at peak before declining)
- amount_needed_for_production_g: 4500 (grams, numeric, matches total - entire batch will be used)
- check_timestamps: [] (array of ISO timestamps, when Marcus/Rachel should visually assess)
- readiness_for_production: false (boolean, quality gate, becomes true at peak)
- float_test_passed: null (boolean or null, test performed near peak time)

Rationale: Production levain is a time-critical intermediate. It must be ready exactly when needed (10 AM - 2 PM window) or the entire day's sourdough schedule delays. The activity_level progresses dormant ‚Üí rising ‚Üí peak ‚Üí falling, and production can only proceed at peak. This creates a timing dependency. Unlike the mother starter which is perpetual, production levain is built fresh daily and fully consumed.

Rationale: Dough batch is the core production tracking object. Its state property drives workflow progression - tasks can only execute when dough is in correct state. The temperature property is critical: out-of-range temps cascade into timing issues. Fold tracking ensures proper gluten development. Quality_score accumulates impacts from all violations (temp, timing, handling). This batch object will spawn 25 individual loaf objects when divided.
```

### TEMPLATE FOR OTHER DOUGH BATCHES:
(Similar structure applies to whole_grain_sourdough_batch, seeded_multigrain_batch, baguette_batch, ciabatta_batch, etc. Each has recipe-specific properties like hydration_percent, add_ins (olives, seeds), and timing parameters.)

- purchase_date: "2023-02-15" (date string)
- purchase_price_usd: 38.00 (USD, numeric)

Rationale: These containers are temporary dough housing during bulk fermentation. Clear material enables visual monitoring of volume increase (key fermentation indicator). The marked_volume_ml property creates a reference point for "doubled" assessment. State management prevents reuse without cleaning (food safety). 12 containers total allows some batch overlap but can become constrained on heavy production days.
```

### TEMPLATE: 11 more containers (IDs cambro_22qt_2 through cambro_22qt_12)
- Each independently tracked
- Can be in different states simultaneously
- Creates realistic constraint: limited clean containers forces cleaning cycles

- rust_present: false (boolean, maintenance flag)

- purchase_date: "2023-02-28" (date string)
- purchase_price_usd: 185.00 (USD, numeric)

Rationale: Cooling racks are spatial constraints that limit production flow. When all 4 racks are full (320 loaf capacity), production must pause until loaves cool and are packaged/moved. The tiers_occupied array allows granular tracking of which shelves have space. Tier_cooling_rate_variance models realistic physics (top shelves cool faster due to heat rising). This creates scheduling pressure on Saturday when production hits capacity.
```

### OBJECTS: cooling_rack_2, cooling_rack_3, cooling_rack_4
[Same structure as cooling_rack_1, with unique IDs]
- Total 4 racks = 80 positions = practical capacity for 320 loaves cooling simultaneously
- Saturday morning: all racks at capacity by 9 AM, blocks further baking

- backup_mixing_method: "hand_mixing" (string, possible but impractical for volume)
- critical_equipment: true (boolean, production severely limited without it)

Rationale: Mixer is second-most critical equipment. Capacity (17kg practical) means large batches must be split into 2-3 sequential mixes. Cycle_time creates scheduling - can't rush mixing. Bowl_state tracking enforces cleaning between batches (food safety). Power consumption significant when running. Maintenance tasks are regular (weekly belt, monthly lubrication). Used equipment means higher failure risk than new. No backup mixer means failure severely impacts production (Scenario #3 variant).

Rationale: Packaging area is transition zone between production and sales. Holding_capacity creates temporary staging constraint. Storage_capacity for packaging supplies (running out blocks sales). Staff_access indicates who performs packaging tasks. Adjacent_to cooling and FOH enables smooth workflow. This zone bridges BOH and FOH.

Properties:
- location_id: "wholesale_staging_area" (string)
- location_type: "wholesale_fulfillment" (string)
- area_sq_ft: 24 (square feet, small dedicated area)

- temperature_current_f: 70 (degrees F)

- equipment_present: ["staging_shelves_labeled_by_customer", "wholesale_packaging_materials", "clipboards_invoices"] (array)

- current_orders_staged: [] (array of order objects with {customer_id, loaf_ids, pickup_time})
- staging_capacity_orders: 6 (integer, max simultaneous orders)

- wholesale_customers: ["cedar_street_cafe", "northside_market", "downtown_deli", "sunday_farmers_market", "corporate_office_building_weekly"] (array, regular accounts)

- typical_order_size_loaves: 15 (integer, average wholesale order)
- pickup_window_morning: "07:30-09:30" (string, when customers pick up)
- delivery_window_marcus: "09:00-10:00" (string, when Marcus delivers)

- invoicing_method: "paper_clipboard_for_pickup_confirmation" (string)
- payment_terms: "net_14_days" (string, invoice payment)

- adjacent_to: ["location_packaging_area", "location_front_of_house_side_door"] (array)
- access_for_customers: "side_door_staff_escorted" (string, wholesale customers don't enter main FOH)

- primary_staff: ["actor_rachel_martinez", "actor_marcus_chen"] (array, who preps wholesale orders)

Rationale: Wholesale staging separates wholesale fulfillment from retail operations. Current_orders_staged tracks what's ready for pickup/delivery. Staging_capacity limits how many orders can be prepped simultaneously. Wholesale_customers array defines accounts. Pickup_window creates timing constraint (orders must be ready by specific time). Payment_terms affect cash flow (not immediate payment like retail).

## SUMMARY STATISTICS

**Total Objects Specified:** 100+ across all categories
- **Actors:** 4 (complete staff)
- **Custom Type Objects:** 50+ (levain cultures, dough batches, individual loaves, oven decks, baskets, containers, racks, storage locations, ingredients)
- **Equipment:** 15+ (standard type for non-custom equipment)
- **Products:** 10 (all bread varieties)
- **Resources:** 15+ (packaging, utilities, cleaning)
- **Locations:** 10+ (spatial zones)

**Key Simulation-Ready Features:**
1. **State Machines:** Every object with lifecycle (dough: mixed ‚Üí fermenting ‚Üí shaped ‚Üí proofing ‚Üí baking ‚Üí cooling ‚Üí sold)
2. **Capacity Constraints:** Oven (24-30 loaves/cycle), Retarder (190 loaves), Cooling (320 positions)
3. **Quality Tracking:** Quality_score (0-100) on all production objects, degrades with violations
4. **Cost Accounting:** Every ingredient, resource, labor hour tracked with USD values
5. **Timing Dependencies:** Timestamps track when processes start/end, enforce minimum durations
6. **Equipment Dependencies:** Objects reference equipment_ids they require, equipment has states
7. **Actor Skills:** Skill levels (0-100) affect quality and task eligibility
8. **Failure Modes:** Malfunction probabilities on all critical equipment
9. **Spatial Tracking:** Location properties enable workflow modeling and movement
10. **Financial Integration:** All costs and revenues flow to profit calculation
