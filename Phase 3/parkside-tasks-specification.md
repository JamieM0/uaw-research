**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Depends On:** None (first task of day)

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** bakery_facility (location)
   **Property Changes:**
   - security_system_state: { from: "armed", to: "disarmed" }
   - main_door_state: { from: "locked", to: "unlocked" }
   - interior_lights_boh: { from: "off", to: "on" }
   
   **Rationale:** Marcus unlocks facility, disables alarm, turns on back-of-house lighting to begin production day.

2. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - location: { from: "offsite", to: "production_zone_mixing" }
   - current_task: { set: "open_001" }
   - shift_status: { from: "off_duty", to: "on_duty" }

   **Rationale:** Marcus transitions from home to work, begins his shift fresh at start of day.

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Must occur before any other production tasks
- Security code must be correct (failure scenario: alarm triggers)
- Typically takes 3-5 minutes but allotted 15 to include walking through facility, brief visual safety check

**Notes:**
- Marcus uses this time to mentally review the day's production plan
- Quick visual scan for any obvious issues (water on floor, unusual smells, etc.)

### TASK ID: open_002
**Name:** Oven Preheat Initiation  
**Emoji:** 🔥  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** oven_area  
**Start Time:** 04:00  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (to set controls, then oven heats passively)  
**Depends On:** open_001

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** main_oven (equipment)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "off", to: "preheating" }
   - power_consumption_current_kw: { from: 0, to: 33 }
   
   **Rationale:** Oven begins drawing maximum power to heat up from ambient temperature.

2. **Object:** deck_1 (oven_deck)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "off", to: "preheating" }
   - temperature_current_f: { set: 70 } (ambient starting point)
   - temperature_target_f: { set: 500 }
   - preheat_start_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   
   **Rationale:** Top deck begins heating process, will take 60-75 minutes to reach target.

3. **Object:** deck_2 (oven_deck)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "off", to: "preheating" }
   - temperature_current_f: { set: 70 }
   - temperature_target_f: { set: 500 }

4. **Object:** deck_3 (oven_deck)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "off", to: "preheating" }
   - temperature_current_f: { set: 70 }
   - temperature_target_f: { set: 500 }
   - preheat_start_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }

5. **Object:** electricity (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_draw_kw: { delta: +33 }
   - peak_demand_today_kw: { set: 33 }
   
   **Rationale:** Oven preheat is highest electrical load of the day, meter records peak demand.

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Oven must preheat minimum 60 minutes before first bake (target: 75 minutes for full saturation)
- All three decks heat simultaneously
- Cannot skip preheating (cold oven = failed bake)
- Temperature rises approximately 6-7°F per minute initially, slower as approaches target

**Notes:**
- This is CRITICAL PATH task - delays here cascade through entire day
- Marcus sets oven controls, confirms heating elements activate (visual check: glow)
- Heating is passive process from this point - no additional labor until oven ready

### TASK ID: open_003
**Name:** Starter Health Assessment  
**Emoji:** 🫙  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** walk_in_cooler → mixing_prep_table  
**Start Time:** 04:00 (concurrent with open_002)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Depends On:** open_001

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** mother_starter (levain_culture)
   **Property Changes:**
   - location: { from: "walk_in_cooler", to: "mixing_prep_table" }
   - temperature_current_f: { from: 38, to: 50 } (begins warming toward ambient)
   
   **Rationale:** Starter pulled from cold storage, will continue to warm passively as Marcus works with it.

2. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "open_003" }
   
   **Rationale:** Marcus's focus shifts to starter assessment.

**Assessment Criteria (recorded as observations, not property changes yet):**
- Visual: Surface should be slightly domed, bubbly
- Aroma: Pleasant tangy smell (NOT vinegary or acetone)
- Consistency: Thick but pourable (100% hydration)

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Marcus's 15 years experience enables rapid assessment (novice would take 10-15 minutes)
- If starter appears weak: will require multiple refreshing feedings (delays levain build by 6-8 hours)
- If starter contaminated: emergency use of backup starter (kept separately)

**Notes:**
- This is QUALITY GATE #1 - weak starter compromises entire sourdough production
- Mother starter health property assessed but not changed yet (feed comes later)

---

### TASK ID: open_004
**Name:** Mother Starter Feeding  
**Emoji:** 🫙  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** mixing_prep_table  
**Start Time:** 04:05  
**Duration:** 25 minutes  
**Depends On:** open_003

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** mother_starter (levain_culture)
   **Property Changes:**
   - weight_g: { from: 600, delta: -200 } (discard portion)
   
   **Rationale:** Remove 200g of old starter before feeding (maintains healthy starter, prevents over-accumulation).

2. **Object:** flour_bread_organic (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_kg: { delta: -0.17 }
   
   **Rationale:** 170g organic bread flour consumed in starter feeding.

3. **Object:** flour_whole_wheat_organic (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_kg: { delta: -0.03 }
   
   **Rationale:** 30g whole wheat flour consumed (15% of starter flour for complexity).

4. **Object:** water_filtered (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_liters: { delta: -0.2 }
   
   **Rationale:** 200g water at 80°F consumed in feeding.

5. **Object:** mother_starter (levain_culture)
   **Property Changes:**
   - weight_g: { delta: +400 } (net: 600 - 200 + 400 = 800g temporary before next day's use)
   - last_fed_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   - next_feeding_due_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp + 10 hours }
   - activity_level: { from: "dormant", to: "rising" }
   - temperature_current_f: { set: 70 }
   
   **Rationale:** Fresh feeding reactivates starter, it will ferment through the day.

6. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "open_004" }
   
   **Rationale:** Marcus focused on this precise task requiring attention to ratios and mixing.

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Feeding ratio must be exact: 1:1:1 (starter:water:flour by weight)
- Water temperature critical: 80°F to accelerate fermentation without killing microbes
- Mix until fully homogeneous (no flour pockets)
- Cannot rush this task - quality of today's starter determines tomorrow's production

**Notes:**
- Discarded portion sometimes saved for experimental recipes or given to staff
- Starter will double in 8-10 hours at room temp, ready for tomorrow's levain build

### TASK ID: open_005
**Name:** Production Levain Build (for Today's Sourdough)  
**Emoji:** 🫙  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** mixing_prep_table  
**Start Time:** 04:30  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Depends On:** open_004

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** production_levain_tuesday (levain_culture) **[NEW OBJECT CREATED]**

   - temperature_current_f: { set: 78 }
   - location: { set: "fermentation_ambient_warm_zone" }
   - readiness_for_production: { set: false }
   
   **Rationale:** Create new production levain batch for today's sourdough mixing (afternoon session).

2. **Object:** mother_starter (levain_culture)
   **Property Changes:**
   - weight_g: { delta: -500 }
   
   **Rationale:** 500g ripe mother starter goes into production levain build.

3. **Object:** flour_bread_organic (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_kg: { delta: -1.7 }
   
   **Rationale:** 1700g bread flour (85% of 2000g total flour in levain).

4. **Object:** flour_whole_wheat_organic (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_kg: { delta: -0.3 }
   
   **Rationale:** 300g whole wheat flour (15% of total).

5. **Object:** water_filtered (resource)
   **Property Changes:**

   - marked_volume_ml: { set: 4500 } (reference point for "doubled")
   - temperature_f: { set: 78 }
   
   **Rationale:** Levain placed in large clear container to monitor volume increase.

7. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "open_005" }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Levain must reach peak activity in 6-8 hours (by 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM window)
- Temperature critical: 78°F ambient accelerates fermentation to 6-8 hour timeline (vs. 10-12 hours at 68°F)
- Must double in volume before use (visual check: clear container marked with tape)
- If not ready by 2:00 PM: cannot mix sourdough today (cascade failure)

**Notes:**
- This levain will be used in afternoon sourdough mixing (12:00-2:00 PM)
- Placed near oven exhaust (78°F microclimate) to accelerate fermentation
- Marcus checks levain every 2 hours: 6:30 AM, 8:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 12:30 PM

### TASK ID: open_006
**Name:** Check Retarder and Pull First Bake Loaves  
**Emoji:** 🥖  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** proofing_retarder  
**Start Time:** 04:45  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Depends On:** open_001

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** proofing_retarder (storage_location)
   **Property Changes:**
   - door_state: { from: "closed", to: "open" }
   - temperature_current_f: { delta: +3 } (temporarily rises when door opened)
   
   **Rationale:** Opening door allows warm air in, temperature will recover when closed.

2. **Object:** country_sourdough_loaf_001 through loaf_020 (individual_loaf) **[20 loaves]**
   **Property Changes:**
   - location: { from: "proofing_retarder", to: "oven_staging_area" }
   - temperature_f: { from: 40, to: 40 } (still cold initially)
   - proof_end_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   - proof_duration_hours: { calculated: current_timestamp - proof_start_timestamp }
   
   **Rationale:** First batch of loaves pulled from overnight cold proof, ready for final assessment and baking.

3. **Object:** proofing_basket_001 through basket_020 (proofing_basket) **[20 baskets]**
   **Property Changes:**
   - location: { from: "proofing_retarder", to: "oven_staging_area" }
   
   **Rationale:** Loaves moved in their baskets, will be turned out just before scoring/baking.

4. **Object:** proofing_retarder (storage_location)
   **Property Changes:**
   - door_state: { from: "open", to: "closed" }
   - temperature_current_f: { delta: -3 } (returns to setpoint over 5 minutes)
   - contents: { remove: [loaf_001 through loaf_020 IDs] }
   - loaf_count_current: { delta: -20 }
   - capacity_utilized_percent: { recalculated based on new count }

5. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "open_006" }
   - location: { from: "mixing_prep_table", to: "proofing_retarder", to: "oven_staging_area" }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Loaves must have cold-proofed 10-12 hours (8 minimum, 16 maximum)
- If proof duration < 8 hours: under-proofed (must allow additional room-temp proof)
- If proof duration > 16 hours: over-proofed (quality degraded, may collapse)
- Door should be open minimal time (under 3 minutes) to prevent temperature rise affecting remaining loaves

**Notes:**
- 20 loaves = first oven load (enough for 2.5 decks, allowing room on each)
- Loaves will warm slightly (40°F → 55°F) over next 15 minutes before baking
- Marcus visually inspects each loaf while pulling (any obvious issues noted)

## PROCESS CATEGORY 2: PRE-BAKE PREPARATION (04:45-05:00)

### TASK ID: prep_001
**Name:** Warm Up and Poke Test First Bake Loaves  
**Emoji:** 👆  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** oven_staging_area  
**Start Time:** 04:45 (concurrent with open_006, happens during/after pull)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Depends On:** open_006

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** country_sourdough_loaf_001 through loaf_020 (individual_loaf) **[each loaf individually assessed]**
   **Property Changes:**
   - temperature_f: { from: 40, to: ~55 } (gradual warming in ambient 70°F environment)
   - poke_test_result: { set: "properly_proofed" OR "under_proofed" OR "over_proofed" }
   
   **Rationale:** As loaves warm, Marcus performs poke test on each - finger pressed into dough, observes spring-back.

2. **Object:** country_sourdough_loaf_001 (example - IF properly proofed)
   **Property Changes:**
   - ready_to_bake: { set: true }
   - quality_score: { maintain at 100 }
   
   **Rationale:** Loaf passes poke test, confirmed ready for baking.

3. **Object:** country_sourdough_loaf_002 (example - IF under-proofed)
   **Property Changes:**
   - under_proofed: { set: true }
   - ready_to_bake: { set: false }
   - quality_score: { delta: -5 }
   - additional_proof_needed_minutes: { set: 30 }
   
   **Rationale:** Springs back too quickly = needs more time, held for later bake.

4. **Object:** country_sourdough_loaf_003 (example - IF over-proofed)
   **Property Changes:**
   - over_proofed: { set: true }
   - ready_to_bake: { set: true } (bake immediately, cannot fix)
   - quality_score: { delta: -20 }
   
   **Rationale:** No spring-back = over-proofed, will bake but expect flat loaf.

5. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "prep_001" }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Poke test only accurate once loaves warm to ~50-60°F (cold dough gives false reading)
- Each loaf takes 30-45 seconds to assess (20 loaves = 10-15 minutes total)
- Decision must be made now: bake immediately or delay
- Over-proofed loaves MUST bake immediately (further delay worsens issue)

**Notes:**
- Typically 90-95% of loaves pass poke test (properly proofed)
- 3-5% may be under-proofed (cold night, shorter proof time)
- 0-2% over-proofed (rare, indicates retarder temperature issue or too-long proof)
- This is QUALITY GATE #2 - determines which loaves bake in first cycle vs. later

[CONTINUING WITH REMAINING TASKS...]

Due to length constraints, I'll now provide the framework for the remaining task categories and a few complete examples from each. The full specification would contain 200+ individual tasks. Let me continue with key representative tasks:

---

## PROCESS CATEGORY 3: BAKING CYCLE 1 (05:00-05:45)

### TASK ID: bake_001
**Name:** Score First Batch - Country Sourdough  
**Emoji:** 🔪  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** oven_staging_area  
**Start Time:** 05:00  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Depends On:** prep_001, [oven must be at temp - checked by open_002 completion + 75 min]

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** main_oven (equipment)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { verify: "ready" } (check only, must be true to proceed)

2. **Object:** deck_1, deck_2, deck_3 (oven_deck)
   **Property Changes:**
   - temperature_current_f: { verify: >= 495 } (must be at target)
   - state: { verify: "ready" }

3. **Object:** country_sourdough_loaf_001 through loaf_020 (individual_loaf)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "cold_proofing", to: "scored" }
   - scoring_pattern: { set: "deep_cross" }
   - scored_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   - scored_by_actor_id: { set: "marcus_chen" }
   
   **Rationale:** Each loaf turned from banneton onto peel, scored with lame in cross pattern.

4. **Object:** proofing_basket_001 through basket_020 (proofing_basket)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "occupied", to: "dirty" }
   - contents_loaf_id: { set: null }
   
   **Rationale:** Loaves removed, baskets now need cleaning before reuse.

5. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "bake_001" }
   - location: { set: "oven_area" }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Scoring must be immediate before loading (scored dough cannot sit more than 5 minutes or skin dries)
- Depth critical: 1/2 inch deep for sourdough (shallow = poor oven spring, deep = collapse)
- Angle of blade: 30-45 degrees to create "ear" (raised crust lip)
- Marcus's skill level (100) ensures consistent quality - less skilled baker would have more variation

**Notes:**
- Scoring is artisanal skill - creates visual signature of bakery
- Cross pattern is Parkside's trademark for Country Sourdough
- Loaves turned seam-side down from basket (seam was facing up during proof)

5. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "bake_002" }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Loading must be fast (under 2 minutes per deck) to minimize heat loss
- Loaves arranged with space between (air circulation critical)
- Cannot overload decks (max 8-10 loaves depending on size)
- Hot environment (decks at 500°F) - marcus must use oven mitts, peel technique

**Notes:**
- Marcus loads all three decks in sequence: deck 1, then 2, then 3
- Total 20 loaves fits comfortably with proper spacing
- Door open time minimized (reduces oven temp drop)

### TASK ID: bake_003
**Name:** Steam Injection - First Bake  
**Emoji:** 💨  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** oven_area  
**Start Time:** 05:18 (immediately after bake_002)  
**Duration:** 15 seconds  
**Depends On:** bake_002

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** deck_1, deck_2, deck_3 (oven_deck)
   **Property Changes:**
   - steam_applied: { set: true }
   - last_steam_injection_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   - vents_state: { set: "closed" }
   
   **Rationale:** Steam injected into all three decks, vents closed to trap moisture.

2. **Object:** main_oven (equipment)
   **Property Changes:**
   - steam_reservoir_full: { from: true, to: false } (small amount water consumed)
   
   **Rationale:** Steam system draws from water reservoir, minimal depletion.

3. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "bake_003" }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- MUST happen within 30 seconds of loading (sooner is better)
- Steam duration: 3-second burst + 8-second sustained = 11 seconds total
- Vents must be closed during steam phase (15 minutes)
- Steam creates humid environment that keeps crust soft initially, allowing maximum oven spring

**Notes:**
- This is CRITICAL for sourdough crust development
- Without steam: loaves will tear randomly, poor oven spring, thick dull crust
- Steam phase allows dough to expand before crust sets

---

### TASK ID: bake_004
**Name:** Monitor Bake and Open Vents (15-Minute Mark)  
**Emoji:** ⏱️  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** oven_area  
**Start Time:** 05:33 (15 minutes into bake)  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
**Depends On:** bake_003

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** deck_1, deck_2, deck_3 (oven_deck)
   **Property Changes:**
   - vents_state: { from: "closed", to: "open" }
   - vents_open_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   
   **Rationale:** Vents opened to release steam, begin dry heat phase for crust caramelization.

2. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "bake_004" }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Timing is approximate guideline (15 minutes), Marcus uses visual cues too
- Vents opened when loaves have expanded fully (oven spring complete)
- Too early: crust sets before full rise
- Too late: pale crust, insufficient browning

**Notes:**
- Marcus does quick visual check through oven window (doesn't open door)
- Remaining 23 minutes is dry heat phase (total 38-minute bake)

**Performed by:** rachel_martinez (actor)  
**Location:** mixing_prep_table  
**Start Time:** 04:35  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Depends On:** rachel_001

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** poolish_baguette_monday_evening (levain_culture)
   **Property Changes:**
   - location: { from: "proofing_retarder", to: "mixing_prep_table" }
   - temperature_current_f: { from: 40, to: 55 } (begins warming)
   - activity_level: { verify: "peak" } (check that poolish is properly fermented)
   
   **Rationale:** Poolish mixed yesterday at 4:00 PM, has fermented 12.5 hours, pulled from retarder and warming.

2. **Object:** flour_bread_conventional (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_kg: { delta: -3.2 }
   
   **Rationale:** 3.2 kg bread flour weighed for baguette final dough.

3. **Object:** water_filtered (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_liters: { delta: -1.4 }
   
   **Rationale:** 1.4 kg water weighed at 70°F (calculated for 76°F target DDT).

4. **Object:** salt_fine_sea (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_kg: { delta: -0.104 }
   
   **Rationale:** 104g salt weighed (2% of total flour).

5. **Object:** yeast_instant_saf (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_kg: { delta: -0.016 }
   
   **Rationale:** 16g instant yeast weighed (0.3% of flour - small amount since poolish provides most fermentation power).

6. **Object:** malt_powder_diastatic (resource)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_quantity_kg: { delta: -0.026 }
   
   **Rationale:** 26g malt powder weighed (0.5% of flour - enhances crust color and flavor).

7. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "rachel_002" }
   - location: { set: "mixing_prep_table" }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- All ingredients must be weighed precisely on digital scale (accuracy to 1 gram)
- Poolish must be at room temp or slightly cool (cold poolish won't incorporate well)
- Water temperature calculation critical: DDT_target × 3 - (room_temp + flour_temp + poolish_temp + friction_factor) = water_temp
- In this case: 76×3 - (70 + 68 + 55 + 22) = 228 - 215 = 13°F... wait, that's too cold. Recalculate: Use 70°F water, accept slightly lower DDT or adjust during mix.

**Notes:**
- Rachel has recipe memorized but double-checks baker's percentages
- Ingredients staged in order of addition to mixer
- Poolish float test performed: small piece dropped in water, should float (indicates good gas production)

    **Rationale:** Energy consumed during mixing tracked.

11. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
    **Property Changes:**
    - current_task: { set: "rachel_003" }
    - fatigue_level: { delta: +1 }

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Autolyse duration is flexible (15-30 min acceptable), but 20 min is optimal
- Dough temperature CRITICAL: must hit 76-78°F (if not, adjust fermentation time or location)
- High-speed mixing time precise: under-mix = weak gluten (loaves won't hold shape), over-mix = tight dough (won't expand in oven)
- Mixer bowl must be clean before loading (if dirty: cleaning task must precede this)

**Notes:**
- Baguette dough is moderately wet (70% hydration) but manageable
- Rachel watches dough texture during high-speed mix: should pull cleanly from bowl in smooth mass
- This batch will bulk ferment 90 minutes, then be shaped into 40 baguettes at 6:25 AM

7. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "rachel_007" }
   - location: { set: "primary_shaping_bench" }
   - fatigue_level: { delta: +3 } (physically demanding task - 40 pieces)

**Dividing Process:**
- Turn dough onto lightly floured bench
- Use bench scraper and scale
- Cut 40 pieces at exactly 325g each (precision critical)
- Each piece gently rounded into short cylinder
- Pieces arranged on bench with space between (prevents sticking)

**Pre-Shape Technique:**
- Flatten each piece slightly
- Fold edges toward center
- Roll gently to create tension
- Result: Short fat cylinder, 4-5 inches long

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Weight precision critical: ±5g acceptable, more variation = uneven baking
- Must work quickly (dough warming, fermentation continuing)
- Bench dusted lightly with flour (too much = dry dough, too little = sticking)
- 40 pieces = 35 minutes work for experienced baker (Rachel's skill level 90)

**Notes:**
- Baguette shaping is Rachel's specialty (skill level 95 for baguettes specifically)
- This is one of bakery's highest-volume items (40/day)
- Bench rest allows gluten to relax before final shaping

### TASK ID: rachel_008
**Name:** Final Shape Baguettes  
**Emoji:** 🥖  
**Performed by:** rachel_martinez (actor)  
**Location:** primary_shaping_bench  
**Start Time:** 06:45 (after 20-minute bench rest)

   **Rationale:** Each baguette shaped to final 14-16 inch length, placed on proofing cloth.

2. **Object:** proofing_cloth_couche_1 (equipment - not previously defined, add to equipment list)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "clean", to: "in_use" }
   - contents: { set: [baguette_001 through baguette_040] }
   - location: { set: "production_zone_shaping" }
   
   **Rationale:** Baguettes arranged on linen couche, pleated fabric between each for support.

**Final Shaping Technique (per baguette):**
- Place pre-shape on unfloured surface (slight stick helps create tension)
- Flatten into rectangle (8 inches wide, 6 inches tall)
- Fold top edge down to center, seal with heel of hand
- Fold in half (top to bottom), seal seam
- Roll with both hands from center outward, applying even pressure
- Taper ends by rolling with fingertips
- Final length: 14-16 inches
- Place seam-side up on couche

**Couche Arrangement:**
- Linen cloth pleated between each baguette (creates "channels")
- Purpose: supports baguettes during proof, prevents flattening
- Spacing: 2 inches between each

3. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "rachel_008" }
   - fatigue_level: { delta: +4 } (intensive repetitive motion, 40 baguettes)

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Shaping speed: 30-40 seconds per baguette for expert (Rachel)
- Consistent technique critical (uniform loaves bake evenly)
- Dough continues fermenting during shaping (later baguettes slightly more fermented than earlier)
- Surface tension must be perfect (too tight = splits during proof, too loose = flat baguettes)

**Notes:**
- This is Rachel's signature skill - her baguettes are why she was hired
- Marcus occasionally observes to ensure consistency
- Baguettes will proof 60-75 minutes at room temp (ready for baking ~8:00 AM)

### TASK ID: rachel_009
**Name:** Check Production Levain Progress (10:30 AM Check)  
**Emoji:** 🫙  
**Performed by:** rachel_martinez (actor)  
**Location:** fermentation_ambient_warm_zone  
**Start Time:** 10:30 (6 hours into levain fermentation)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Depends On:** open_005 + 6 hours elapsed

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** production_levain_tuesday (levain_culture)
   **Property Changes:**
   - activity_level: { assess: currently "rising" or approaching "peak" }
   - volume_increase_since_build: { estimate: 60-80% }
   - temperature_current_f: { measured: ~78 }
   
   **Rationale:** Visual and smell assessment of levain progress.

2. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "rachel_009" }
   - location: { temporarily: "fermentation_ambient_warm_zone" }

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Volume: Should be 60-90% increased by 6-hour mark
- Surface: Starting to dome (not flat)
- Bubbles: Visible throughout, especially on sides of clear container
- Aroma: Pleasant yeasty smell (not overly acidic)

**Decision:**
- If levain looks good: Continue fermenting, check again at 11:30 AM
- If levain sluggish: Move to warmer location, extend timeline
- If levain too active: Move to cooler location to slow down

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Levain readiness is somewhat unpredictable (±1-2 hours variance)
- Must be ready by 2:00 PM latest (or sourdough mixing delayed to next day)
- Float test can be performed if unsure: drop small piece in water, should float

**Notes:**
- Rachel makes mental note to check again in 1 hour
- Marcus trusts Rachel's assessment (she's done this hundreds of times)
- This is not a critical decision point yet (just monitoring)

## PROCESS CATEGORY 6: SATURDAY AFTERNOON SHAPING SESSION (12:00-14:00)

**CONTEXT:** This is the CRITICAL shaping session where tomorrow's (Sunday's) sourdough loaves are shaped and loaded into retarder for overnight cold proof. This happens AFTER production levain has reached peak and sourdough doughs have been mixed and bulk fermented.

### TASK ID: shape_001
**Name:** Assess Country Sourdough Batch 1 Bulk Fermentation Completion  
**Emoji:** 👁️  
**Performed by:** marcus_chen (actor)  
**Location:** fermentation_zone  
**Start Time:** 12:00  
**Duration:** 5 minutes

   - poke_test_result: { assessed: "springs_back_slow" }
   - state: { from: "bulk_fermenting", to: "ready_for_shaping" }
   
   **Rationale:** Visual, tactile, and poke test confirm bulk fermentation complete.

2. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_001" }
   - location: { set: "fermentation_zone" }

**Assessment Tests:**
- **Volume:** 75-100% increase from initial (marked on container)
- **Wobble:** Shake container gently, dough jiggles = good gas retention
- **Poke:** Finger pressed in, springs back slowly halfway = ready
- **Visual:** Domed surface, bubbles throughout

**Decision:**
- All indicators positive → Proceed to shaping immediately
- If any indicators weak → Extend bulk fermentation 30-60 minutes, re-assess

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Timing window is flexible (±30 minutes) but cannot delay past 1:00 PM (impacts retarder loading schedule)
- Over-fermented dough will collapse during shaping (irreversible)
- Under-fermented dough will result in dense loaves tomorrow

**Notes:**
- This is QUALITY GATE #4 - determines readiness for shaping
- Marcus's 15 years experience enables rapid accurate assessment
- Batch 2 (mixed 1 hour later) will be assessed at 1:00 PM

3. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_002" }
   - location: { set: "primary_shaping_bench" }

**Prep Activities:**
- Wipe bench with damp cloth if needed
- Light dusting of bench flour (minimal - too much dries dough)
- Stage bench scraper, scale, baskets within arm's reach
- Verify baskets properly floured (rice flour prevents sticking)

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Cannot begin dividing until bench fully prepped
- Baskets must be checked for cleanliness (any mold = discard and wash)
- Flour coating should be fresh (re-dust if used earlier in week)

**Notes:**
- Rachel and Marcus will work simultaneously during shaping (2 shapers = faster)
- Organization critical for efficiency (50 loaves in 90-120 minutes)

   **Property Changes:**
   - loaf_id: { set: "country_sourdough_021_tue_20251022" through "country_sourdough_070_tue_20251022" }
   - parent_batch_id: { set: "country_sourdough_batch1_tuesday" }
   - product_type: { set: "country_sourdough_900g" }
   - state: { set: "divided" }
   - weight_g: { set: 1000 } (each piece weighed to ±10g precision)
   - weight_target_g: { set: 1000 }
   - weight_variance_percent: { calculated based on actual weight }
   - divided_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   - location: { set: "primary_shaping_bench" }
   
   **Rationale:** 25 kg dough divided into 50 pieces at 1000g each (pre-bake weight, becomes 900g after moisture loss in oven).

4. **Object:** country_sourdough_batch1_tuesday (dough_batch)
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "divided", to: "bench_resting" }

5. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_003" }
   - fatigue_level: { delta: +2 }

**Dividing Process:**
- Gently turn dough from container onto lightly floured bench
- Minimal handling (preserve gas structure)
- Use bench scraper to cut precise portions
- Each piece placed on scale: target 1000g (±10g acceptable)
- Pieces arranged in rows on bench with space between

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Dividing must be efficient but gentle (preserve dough structure)
- Precision important but not obsessive (±10g = 1% variance, acceptable)
- Dough continues fermenting during dividing (first pieces shaped sooner than last)
- 50 pieces = ~20 minutes for experienced divider (Rachel's skill level 85 for sourdough)

**Notes:**
- Rachel divides, Marcus may assist if available
- Scale used continuously (each piece weighed)
- Goal: uniform loaves that bake evenly tomorrow

### TASK ID: shape_004
**Name:** Pre-Shape Country Sourdough (50 Loaves)  
**Emoji:** ⭕  
**Performed by:** rachel_martinez and marcus_chen (actors working in parallel)  
**Location:** primary_shaping_bench  
**Start Time:** 12:25  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Depends On:** shape_003

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** country_sourdough_loaf_021 through loaf_070 (individual_loaf) **[50 loaves]**
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "divided", to: "preshaped" }
   - preshaped_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   - bench_rest_start_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   - bench_rest_duration_minutes: { set: 25 }
   
   **Rationale:** Each piece gently shaped into loose oval, now resting on bench.

2. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_004" }
   - fatigue_level: { delta: +2 }

3. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_004" }
   - location: { set: "primary_shaping_bench" }
   - fatigue_level: { delta: +1 }

**Pre-Shaping Technique:**
- Pick up divided piece
- Gently flatten into rough rectangle
- Fold edges toward center (creates initial tension)
- Flip over seam-side down
- Cup hands around dough, drag in circular motion (tightens surface)
- Result: Loose round/oval with slight surface tension
- Place on bench with space between pieces

**Work Division:**
- Rachel and Marcus work simultaneously
- Rachel: Loaves 1-25 (left side of bench)
- Marcus: Loaves 26-50 (right side of bench)
- Working together: 50 loaves in 15 minutes (vs. 30 minutes solo)

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Pre-shape must be gentle (don't degas dough completely)
- Create just enough tension for dough to hold shape during rest
- Too tight = dough resists final shaping, too loose = flat loaves
- Each loaf takes 15-20 seconds for experienced shaper

**Notes:**
- Bench rest allows gluten to relax (makes final shaping easier)
- During 25-minute rest, Rachel may start dividing Batch 2 or take brief break
- Pre-shaped loaves covered lightly with plastic to prevent drying

### TASK ID: shape_005
**Name:** Final Shape Country Sourdough - Bâtards (50 Loaves)  
**Emoji:** 🥖  
**Performed by:** rachel_martinez and marcus_chen (actors)  
**Location:** primary_shaping_bench  
**Start Time:** 12:50 (after 25-minute bench rest)  
**Duration:** 40 minutes  
**Depends On:** shape_004 + 25 minutes bench rest

**Interactions:**

1. **Object:** country_sourdough_loaf_021 through loaf_070 (individual_loaf) **[50 loaves]**
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "preshaped", to: "final_shaped" }
   - final_shaped_timestamp: { set: current_timestamp }
   - final_shape_style: { set: "batard" }
   - proofing_basket_id: { set: corresponding basket_id }
   - location: { from: "primary_shaping_bench", to: "banneton_basket_XXX" }
   
   **Rationale:** Each loaf shaped into tight oval (bâtard shape), placed seam-side up in oval banneton.

2. **Object:** proofing_basket_001 through proofing_basket_050 (proofing_basket) **[50 baskets]**
   **Property Changes:**
   - state: { from: "empty", to: "occupied" }
   - contents_loaf_id: { set: corresponding loaf_id }
   - location: { from: "near_shaping_bench", to: "speed_rack_staging" }
   
   **Rationale:** Each basket now holds one loaf, moved to rack for transport to retarder.

3. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_005" }
   - fatigue_level: { delta: +4 } (intensive repetitive work)

4. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_005" }
   - fatigue_level: { delta: +3 }

**Final Shaping Technique (Bâtard/Oval):**
- Place pre-shaped loaf top-side down on lightly floured surface
- Flatten gently into rectangle (short side toward you)
- Fold top edge down to center, press to seal with heel of hand
- Fold bottom edge up to center, press to seal
- Fold in half (top to bottom), seal seam with heel of hand
- Roll gently with hands from center outward (creates slight taper at ends)
- Result: Oval loaf 10-12 inches long, tight skin on surface
- Place seam-side UP in floured oval banneton (this is critical - seam up means scored side will be on top when flipped for baking)
- Cover basket with plastic

**Work Division:**
- Rachel: 30 loaves (she's faster)
- Marcus: 20 loaves
- Working in parallel: 50 loaves in 40 minutes
- Each loaf takes 45-60 seconds for expert shaping

**Quality Control:**
- Marcus observes Rachel's technique periodically (ensures consistency)
- If loaf doesn't shape well: re-work once (twice = quality degraded, accept imperfection)
- Seam closure critical (poor seal = loaf opens during proof)

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Surface tension must be perfect (too loose = flat loaf, too tight = tears)
- Seam must be well-sealed (prevents loaf from opening during cold proof)
- Cannot rush (quality over speed)
- Physical fatigue increases with repetitions (harder to maintain consistency by loaf #50)

**Notes:**
- This is skilled artisan work - requires practice to perfect
- Bâtard shape is Parkside's signature for Country Sourdough
- Shaped loaves immediately staged for retarder loading (cannot sit more than 30 minutes before cold proof begins)

5. **Object:** rachel_martinez (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_006" }
   - location: { temporarily: "proofing_retarder" }

6. **Object:** marcus_chen (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "shape_006" }
   - location: { temporarily: "proofing_retarder" }

**Loading Process:**
- Baskets arranged on sheet pans (for structural support during move)
- Pans placed on speed rack (rolling cart)
- Rack rolled from shaping area to retarder
- Pans transferred from rack to retarder shelves
- Baskets organized by product type (all Country Sourdough together)
- Each basket covered with plastic wrap or shower cap (prevents drying)
- Ensure air circulation (don't pack too tightly)

**Organization Strategy:**
- Front section: Country Sourdough (loaves 021-070)
- Middle section: Will hold Whole Grain (loaves to be shaped next)
- Rear section: Will hold Multigrain (shaped last)
- Logical organization enables easy retrieval tomorrow morning

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Door should be open minimum time (< 5 minutes per loading session)
- Cannot overload retarder (max 190 loaves practical capacity)
- Must allow air circulation around baskets
- Plastic covering critical (prevents skin forming on dough surface)

**Notes:**
- This is first load of three today (Country, then Whole Grain, then Multigrain)
- Retarder temperature will drop loaves from 70°F to 40°F over 1 hour
- Cold retardation dramatically slows fermentation (enables overnight proof without over-proofing)
- Loaves will be baked tomorrow starting at 5:00 AM (11-hour cold proof total)

3. **Object:** david_kim (actor)
   **Property Changes:**
   - current_task: { set: "cool_001" }
   - location: { set: "cooling_zone" }

**Assessment Method:**
- Touch test: Loaf should be barely warm or room temperature
- Time check: Minimum 3 hours elapsed for sourdough
- Visual: No steam visible when loaf is broken (steam = too warm)

**Decision:**
- If adequately cooled: Flag for packaging (move to packaging area)
- If still warm: Wait another 30-60 minutes, re-check

**Realistic Constraints:**
- Packaging hot bread = soggy crust + mold growth (shelf life reduced from 3 days to 1 day)
- Rush to package during busy retail = common mistake
- Different products have different cooling requirements:
  - Baguettes: 30-45 minutes (thin, cool fast)
  - Sourdough: 3 hours
  - Rye: 6-8 hours (critical - must not rush)

**Notes:**
- David performs this check every hour on different batches
- Once flagged as "ready for packaging," Sarah or David will package as time allows
- Not all loaves packaged immediately (some stay on rack until needed for retail display)
