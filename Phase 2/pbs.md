  - Water: 2380g at 75°F (85% hydration)

  - Salt: 56g (2%)

  - Instant yeast: 28g (1%)

  - Olive oil (in dough): 112g (4%)

  - Levain (optional enhancement): 448g (16% - adds complexity)

- **Mixing:**

  - Combine flour, water, salt, yeast, levain in mixer bowl

  - **Low speed:** 3 minutes (just combined)

  - **Rest:** 20 minutes (short autolyse)

  - Add olive oil

  - **Low speed:** 2 minutes (incorporate oil)

  - **High speed:** 5 minutes (smooth, glossy dough - should be very
    sticky and slack)

- Transfer to oiled tub (22-quart), cover

- **Bulk fermentation:** 2-3 hours at room temp with 3 sets of folds at
  45-minute intervals

  - Alternatively: Can immediately transfer to walk-in cooler for long
    cold fermentation (8-24 hours) - this is Marcus\'s preferred method
    for deeper flavor

  - **Today\'s plan:** Cold ferment immediately, will shape and bake
    this afternoon or tomorrow morning

**6:00 AM - 6:30 AM: Oven Monitoring and Second Bake Prep (30 min)**

- Marcus is managing first and second oven loads (Country Sourdough,
  Whole Grain)

- David assists:

  - Monitor oven timer

  - Prepare cooling racks (ensure empty racks are positioned near oven)

  - Help transfer hot loaves from oven to racks (Marcus pulls, David
    receives and stages)

- During this time, also assess FOH needs:

  - Is display case clean and ready? (Sarah will stock when she arrives
    at 6:30 AM)

  - Any wholesale orders needing prep? (Assist Marcus if needed)

**6:30 AM - 7:00 AM: Sandwich Loaf Assistance (30 min)**

- Marcus is focusing on Whole Wheat Sandwich dough (see Marcus\'s
  schedule)

- David assists with:

  - Greasing loaf pans (20 x 9\"x5\" pans, use butter or pan spray)

  - Staging pans on speed rack near shaping area

  - Later: Helping monitor bulk fermentation, performing poke tests

**7:00 AM - 8:00 AM: Olive & Rosemary Sourdough Prep (if
Wednesday/Friday/Saturday) (60 min)**

- **Today is Tuesday:** Skip this task

- **On production days (Wed/Fri/Sat):**

  - Mix Olive & Rosemary variant (similar to Country Sourdough but with
    add-ins)

  - Kalamata olives: Pre-chop, drain, dry (12% of dough weight)

  - Fresh rosemary: Strip from stems, chop fine

  - Add olives and rosemary during final mix stage (after levain and
    salt)

  - Bulk fermentation: Same as standard sourdough

**8:00 AM - 9:00 AM: Mid-Morning Baking Round (60 min)**

- By this time, Marcus has loaded baguettes into oven (see Marcus\'s
  8:00 AM slot)

- David\'s role:

  - **Monitor baguette bake:** Watch through oven window for color
    development

  - **Set backup timer** (redundancy in case Marcus\'s timer is missed)

  - When baguettes are done:

    - Help transfer to cooling racks

    - Visual quality check (report any issues to Marcus)

- Clean oven exterior (wipe down door glass, control panel)

- Prepare for sandwich loaf bake (Marcus is shaping loaves during this
  time)

**9:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Ciabatta Fold Cycles (60 min)**

- Rachel is managing ciabatta dough (see Rachel\'s 11:30 AM ciabatta
  prep)

- During ciabatta\'s 3-hour bulk fermentation, it needs 4
  stretch-and-fold cycles

- David assists Rachel:

  - Every 45 minutes, perform folds on ciabatta (oiled hands, very
    gentle)

  - Between fold cycles: Help with other production tasks (packaging,
    cleaning)

**10:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Sandwich Loaf Baking and Monitoring (60 min)**

- Sandwich loaves are loaded by Marcus at \~9:30 AM (after final proof
  complete)

- David\'s primary focus:

  - **Monitor oven temperature** (should be steady at 360°F)

  - **Watch bake timer** (38 minutes)

  - At 25-minute mark: Visual check through door (color development on
    crust)

  - At timer completion: Help unload loaves

    - Use oven mitts, pull pans from oven

    - **Immediately remove loaves from pans** (prevents soggy bottom
      crust)

    - Transfer loaves to cooling rack

  - **Internal temp check:** Use instant-read thermometer on 2-3 loaves
    (should be 200-205°F)

- While loaves cool, clean loaf pans, dry, store for next use

**11:00 AM - 12:00 PM: FOH Restocking and Display Management (60 min)**

- **This is peak retail period (late morning)**

- Work with Sarah (FOH lead) to keep display case fully stocked:

  - Pull cooled loaves from racks (must be completely cool, at least 2
    hours post-bake)

  - Transfer to FOH holding shelves or directly to display case

  - Arrange attractively in display case:

    - Visual merchandising: Larger loaves upright, baguettes angled,
      focaccia visible

    - Ensure price tags visible

- Replenish packaging supplies at counter (bags, stickers, twine)

- **Quality control:** Scan all products in display for any defects,
  remove if found

- Check FOH inventory:

  - What\'s selling fast? (need to ramp up production tomorrow?)

  - What\'s slow? (reduce production or mark down)

**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Ciabatta Shaping and Final Proof (60 min)**

- Ciabatta bulk fermentation complete (\~3 hours elapsed)

- Assist Rachel or work independently:

  - Turn dough onto heavily floured surface (minimal disturbance,
    preserve gas)

  - **Divide:** Use bench scraper, cut into 15 portions (\~600g each)

  - **No pre-shape, no intensive shaping:** Ciabatta is minimally
    handled

  - Gently coax each piece into rough slipper shape (elongated
    rectangle)

  - Place on parchment-lined sheet pans (heavily floured), 3 loaves per
    pan

- **Final proof:** 30-45 minutes at room temp (very short proof)

- Prepare oven: Preheat to 480°F, ready steam injection

**1:00 PM - 1:30 PM: Ciabatta Baking (30 min)**

- Load ciabatta into oven:

  - Slide parchment paper with loaves directly onto oven stone (or bake
    on sheet pans)

  - Heavy steam injection (ciabatta needs lots of steam for open crumb)

- **Bake time:** 25-30 minutes

- Monitor closely (high-hydration dough can be unpredictable)

- **Unload:** Transfer to cooling rack, remove parchment if stuck

- **Quality check:** Ciabatta should be golden, rustic (irregular
  shape), sound hollow when tapped

**1:30 PM - 2:00 PM: Afternoon Cleanup and Prep for Next Day (30 min)**

- **End-of-shift tasks:**

  - Clean oven area (sweep flour, wipe surfaces)

**3.3 Task Dependencies and Timing Constraints**

**CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS:**

The production workflow has several hard constraints that create
dependencies:

**1. Starter/Levain Dependency:**

- **Starter health** dictates all sourdough production

- If starter is weak: Entire sourdough schedule delays by 2-4 hours (or
  shifts to next day)

- Levain build timing: Must be started 6-8 hours before main dough mix

  - Example: Tomorrow\'s 6:00 AM sourdough mix requires levain built by
    10:00 PM tonight

  - **Consequence of missed levain build:** No sourdough production next
    day, revenue loss of \$800-1,200

**2. Oven as Bottleneck:**

- Oven capacity: 24-30 loaves per full load (3 decks)

- Bake time: 25-45 minutes per batch (product-dependent)

- Recovery time between bakes: 10-15 minutes (oven returns to
  temperature)

- **Maximum daily throughput:**

  - Available baking hours: 5:00 AM - 2:00 PM (9 hours)

  - Realistic bake cycles: 10-12 cycles per day

  - Maximum loaves: 240-300 per day (theoretical)

  - **Actual production:** 180-220 loaves per day (leaves buffer for
    issues, cooling time management)

- **Constraint:** Cannot increase production beyond oven capacity
  without second oven or extended hours

**3. Retarder Capacity Constraint:**

- Retarder holds 36 sheet pans, equivalent to \~180-200 loaves in
  bannetons

- **This caps the maximum number of sourdough loaves that can be
  cold-proofed overnight**

- If demand exceeds 200 loaves:

  - Option A: Add second retarder unit (\$1,500-3,000 investment)

  - Option B: Stagger production (some loaves same-day proof, some
    overnight proof)

  - Option C: Decline orders (current strategy to maintain quality)

**4. Cooling Rack Capacity Constraint:**

- 4 cooling racks x 20 pans per rack = 80 pans total cooling capacity

- Each loaf needs 2-4 hours cooling before packaging

- **During peak production (Saturday):**

  - Morning bake (5:00 AM - 11:00 AM): 75 loaves produced

  - These loaves occupy all cooling racks until 1:00-3:00 PM

  - **Consequence:** Cannot start afternoon bake until racks clear (or
    purchase more racks)

- **Current mitigation:** Stagger baking to align with cooling/packaging
  rhythm

**5. Shaping Bench Time:**

- Primary shaping bench: 96\"L x 30\"D = 20 sq ft surface

- Can comfortably shape 8-10 loaves simultaneously (more if working in
  batches)

- **Afternoon shaping session (12:00-2:00 PM):** 95 loaves need shaping
  for next day

- With 2 people (Marcus + Rachel): \~60 loaves/hour shaped (pre-shape,
  rest, final shape)

- **Time requirement:** Minimum 90-120 minutes for full shaping session

- **Constraint:** Cannot compress this time significantly without
  sacrificing quality

**6. Customer Flow Timing:**

- **Morning rush (7:00-9:00 AM):** Display case must be stocked

- **Problem:** Many loaves still cooling during rush (just baked
  5:00-7:00 AM)

- **Solution:** Use previous day\'s production for early morning stock,
  rotate in fresh bread as it cools

- **Weekend challenge:** Higher volume, tighter timing

  - Saturday rush begins at 7:00 AM, but peak production is 6:00-10:00
    AM

  - **Mitigation:** Friday night prep (more loaves shaped, retarded for
    Saturday bake)

  - Roll from center outwards, gentle pressure, taper ends

  - Target length: 14-16 inches

- **Proof on couche:** Seam-side up, linen pleated between each baguette

- **Final proof:** 60-75 minutes at room temp (until puffy, poke test
  slow spring-back)

**Baking (Same Day Production - No Retarding):**

- **Oven temp:** 480°F

- **Scoring:** Single diagonal slash down length, 1/4\" deep, 30-degree
  angle (classic baguette score)

- **Steam:** Heavy injection (3-second burst + 10-second sustained -
  baguettes need lots of steam)

- **Bake time:** 22-25 minutes

- **Target:** Deep golden-brown crust, crackly surface texture

- **Internal temp:** 205-207°F

**Cooling:** 30-45 minutes (baguettes cool quickly due to high surface
area, thin shape)

- Olive Oil: 600g (10%)

- Instant Yeast: 12g (0.2%)

- **Total Dough: 9.75 kg**

**True Hydration:** 85% (VERY high - this is a wet, sticky, slack dough)

**Mixing Process:**

- Add biga (torn into small pieces), most water, flour, salt, yeast to
  mixer

- Low speed 3 min (rough incorporation)

- **Bassinage technique:** Slowly stream in remaining water and olive
  oil while mixer runs on low (5 min)

- High speed 5 min (dough becomes glossy, sticky, pulls from bowl but
  still very slack)

- **DDT:** 76-78°F

**Bulk Fermentation:**

- **Duration:** 3 hours at 78°F

- **4 stretch-and-folds** with heavily oiled hands at 45-minute
  intervals

- Dough will become billowy, full of large bubbles (this is desired -
  open crumb structure)

**Shaping:**

- **NO INTENSIVE SHAPING** - ciabatta is \"coaxed\" not shaped

- Turn dough onto heavily floured surface (generous flour, 1/4\" layer)

- Cut with bench scraper into 15 pieces (650g each)

- Gently stretch each piece into rough rectangular \"slipper\" shape

- Minimal handling (preserve gas bubbles)

- **Total: \$1.89 per loaf**

**Retail Price:** \$7.50 per loaf\
**Wholesale Price:** \$4.90 per loaf

**Production Notes:**

- Most technically challenging bread (very high hydration, delicate
  handling)

- David typically manages ciabatta production under Marcus\'s
  supervision

- Can only produce if high-protein flour in stock (regular bread flour
  will not hold 85% hydration properly)

- Rye Levain: 1.43 kg

- Salt: 115g

- Caraway Seeds (toasted): 115g (optional, customer preference)

- **Total Dough: 12 kg**

**True Hydration:** 82.5% (high hydration - rye absorbs lots of water
but has weak gluten)

**Special Note on Rye:**

- Rye flour has very weak gluten, high pentosan content (gums that bind
  water)

- Dough will be sticky, dense, and NOT elastic like wheat doughs

- Requires gentle handling, cannot be over-mixed or over-shaped

**Mixing Process:**

- **NO autolyse** (rye enzymatic activity is very fast, can degrade
  dough)

- Mix all ingredients together immediately

- Low speed 2 min, high speed 3 min (MINIMAL mixing - over-mixing
  activates too many enzymes)

- **DDT:** 76°F

**Bulk Fermentation:**

- **Duration:** 3-4 hours (shorter than wheat sourdoughs)

- **2 gentle folds** (rye dough is fragile)

- **Completion:** Slight volume increase (NOT the dramatic rise of wheat
  doughs)

**Shaping:**

- **Divide:** 1000g portions

- **Pre-shape:** Very gentle round, 20-minute rest

- **Final shape:** Gentle boule (do NOT create tight skin - rye dough
  will tear)

- Place in heavily floured round banneton

**Proofing:**

- **Cold retard:** 8-10 hours at 40°F (shorter than wheat -
  over-proofing causes collapse)

**Baking:**

- **Oven temp:** 475°F (slightly lower - rye burns easily)

- **Scoring:** Simple cross or single slash (rye doesn\'t \"open\"
  scores like wheat)

- **Steam:** Heavy steam (rye crust benefits from moisture)

- **Bake time:** 45-50 minutes (longer - dense crumb needs time to bake
  through)

- **Internal temp:** 205-207°F

**Cooling:**

- **CRITICAL:** 6-8 hours minimum, ideally 12-24 hours

- Rye has high moisture content and pentosans continue to set during
  cooling

- Slicing too early = gummy, under-set crumb (common mistake)

**Ingredient Cost per Loaf:**

- Bread flour: \$0.88

- Rye flour: \$1.56 (rye is expensive, specialty flour)

- Levain: \$0.24

- Caraway: \$0.26

- Salt: \$0.03

- **Total: \$2.98 per loaf**

**Retail Price:** \$9.75 per loaf\
**Wholesale Price:** \$6.25 per loaf

**Production Notes:**

- Most challenging bread technically (rye behavior very different from
  wheat)

- Marcus handles 100% of rye production (requires experience)

- Long cooling time creates scheduling challenge

- Limited production (Thu/Sat only) due to complexity

- Some customers specifically seek rye for health benefits (lower
  glycemic index)

**PRODUCT #9: Rosemary Focaccia**

- Total dough: 4.8 kg

**Scaled Ingredients:**

- Bread Flour: 2.3 kg

- Water: 1.96 kg at 75°F

- Instant Yeast: 23g

- Salt: 46g

- Olive Oil (in dough): 92g

- Levain: 368g

- **Total Dough: 4.8 kg**

**True Hydration:** 87% (including levain water - very wet, slack dough)

**Mixing Process:**

- Combine all ingredients (no autolyse needed)

- Low speed 3 min

- Rest 15 min

- Add olive oil

- Low speed 2 min, high speed 4 min (dough becomes glossy, sticky)

- **DDT:** 76°F

**Fermentation Options:**

- **Option A (Same-Day):** 2-3 hours bulk at room temp with 3 folds

- **Option B (Cold Ferment - PREFERRED):** Immediately to walk-in
  cooler, 12-24 hours cold bulk fermentation

  - This develops better flavor, creates schedule flexibility

**Shaping:**

- Coat 9\"x13\" sheet pans (or half-sheet pans) generously with olive
  oil (3-4 tablespoons per pan)

- Divide dough into 4 portions (1200g each)

- Place one portion in each oiled pan

- With oiled hands, gently press and stretch dough toward edges of pan

- **If dough resists:** Cover, rest 20-30 minutes, stretch again

- Repeat until dough covers pan evenly

- Cover pans, allow final proof

**Final Proof:**

- **Duration:** 1.5-3 hours at room temp (until puffy, airy, nearly
  doubled)

- **Depends on:** Dough temperature (cold-fermented dough takes longer)

**Pre-Bake Topping:**

- Drizzle surface generously with olive oil (2-3 tablespoons per sheet)

- **Dimpling:** Press fingertips firmly down through dough to pan bottom
  (creates characteristic dimples)

  - This redistributes gas, prevents giant bubbles

- Sprinkle with flaky sea salt (e.g., Maldon) - generous pinch

- Press fresh rosemary sprigs into dough (decorative and aromatic)

**Baking:**

- **Oven temp:** 450°F

- **No steam** (focaccia is baked in oiled pan, creates its own steam)

- **Bake time:** 20-25 minutes

- **Target:** Golden-brown top and bottom, crispy edges, soft center

- **Internal temp:** Not critical (visual assessment primary)

**Cooling:**

- Cool in pan 10 minutes

- Remove from pan (loosen edges with spatula)

- Cool on rack 30 minutes

- **Cut into 6 pieces per sheet** (typically 4\"x5\" rectangles)

**Ingredient Cost per Sheet (6 portions):**

- **TOTAL: \~\$5,444/month** (Cost of Goods Sold for ingredients only)

**Note:** This represents COGS of approximately 14.6% of gross revenue
(see Financials section for revenue)

**Achieving 18% COGS - Strategic Sourcing Advantages:**

Parkside's below-average COGS (18% vs. industry benchmark of 25-35%)
results from several strategic advantages:

1.  **Long-term supplier relationships:** Marcus's 15 years in the
    industry have enabled him to negotiate locked-in wholesale pricing
    approximately 20% below typical market rates through multi-year
    contracts and volume commitments with regional distributors.

2.  **Strategic ingredient blend:** The 60/40 organic/conventional flour
    blend balances premium positioning with cost management. Organic
    flour is reserved for flagship sourdough products where customers
    notice and value it most, while conventional flour is used in
    enriched breads and focaccia where other flavors dominate.

3.  **High-margin product mix optimization:** Focaccia represents
    approximately 15% of total production volume but contributes
    disproportionately to gross margin (94% gross margin per portion).
    This strategic product mix pulls the blended average COGS downward.

4.  **Minimal ingredient waste:** Precise production planning based on
    2.5 years of sales data keeps ingredient spoilage under 2%, compared
    to the industry average of 5-8%. Every gram of flour is either baked
    into product or intentionally used in levain maintenance.

5.  **Direct relationships with local producers:** Fresh rosemary,
    seasonal fruit, and some dairy come directly from local farms at
    wholesale prices, eliminating distributor markup (typically 15-25%).

These factors combine to create a sustainable cost advantage that, while
exceptional, is achievable for an experienced owner-operator with strong
industry connections and disciplined operations.

  Variable

- **Effective Owner Income:** \$70,000-80,000 depending on profit
  distribution

**PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS:**

**Gross Profit Margin:** 82.0%

- **Interpretation:** Excellent gross margin, indicating strong pricing
  power and efficient ingredient use

- **Industry benchmark:** 65-75% is typical for bakeries

- **Parkside advantage:** Focus on high-margin focaccia and specialty
  breads elevates average

**Operating Profit Margin (EBITDA):** 28.9%

- **Interpretation:** Very strong operating performance

- **Industry benchmark:** 15-25% is good for small bakeries

- **Parkside advantage:** Lean staffing, efficient operations, strong
  wholesale relationships

**Net Profit Margin:** 27.3% (before owner distribution) or 15.7% (after
owner draw)

- **Interpretation:** Exceptional profitability for a small bakery

- **Industry benchmark:** 5-15% net profit is typical, 20%+ is excellent

- **Parkside success factors:**

  - Low rent (suburban location)

  - Efficient COGS (18.0% vs. industry average 25-35%)

  - Strong product mix (high-margin focaccia balances lower-margin
    sandwich loaves)

  - Lean operation (4 employees producing \$450K revenue)

**KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS:**

**Prime Cost Ratio:** (COGS + Labor) / Revenue = 55.9%

- **Interpretation:** VERY GOOD (industry target is \<65%, many bakeries
  run 70-75%)

- This is the most critical metric in food service - Parkside\'s
  efficiency here drives profitability

**Revenue per Labor Hour:**

- Total weekly labor hours: \~165 hours (Marcus 50, Rachel 45, David 39,
  Sarah 30)

- Weekly revenue: \$9,348

- **Revenue per labor hour: \$56.65**

- **Industry benchmark:** \$40-50/hour is good

- **Interpretation:** High productivity team, efficient workflows

**Revenue per Square Foot:**

- Annual revenue: \$448,704

- Square footage: 1,500 sq ft

- **Revenue per sq ft: \$299/year**

- **Industry benchmark:** \$200-250/sq ft for bakery/cafe

- **Interpretation:** Above-average space utilization

**Break-Even Analysis:**

**Monthly Fixed Costs:** \$5,085

**Contribution Margin:**

- Average selling price per loaf (weighted): \$8.15

- Average variable cost per loaf (COGS + variable labor): \$2.85

- **Contribution margin per loaf: \$5.30 (65%)**

**Break-Even Point:**

- Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin = \$5,085 / \$5.30 = **959
  loaves/month**

- **Current production:** 1,190 loaves/week x 4 = **4,760 loaves/month**

- **Break-even reached at:** 20% of current production volume

**Safety Margin:** Parkside operates at 496% of break-even volume

- **Interpretation:** Very safe financial position, can absorb
  significant sales decline

**6. CONSTRAINTS AND COMPLICATIONS**

**6.1 Equipment Capacity Bottlenecks**

**PRIMARY BOTTLENECK: Oven Capacity**

**Current State:**

- 3-deck oven, \~25 loaves per full cycle

- **Maximum theoretical daily capacity:** 300 loaves (12 bake cycles x
  25 loaves)

- **Practical daily capacity:** 250 loaves (10-11 cycles, allowing
  buffer)

- **Saturday production:** 250 loaves (AT CAPACITY)

**Implications:**

- Cannot increase weekend production without equipment investment

- Any equipment failure on Saturday = catastrophic revenue loss
  (\$2,200)

- Cannot accept large special orders (e.g., corporate event for 100
  loaves) without disrupting regular production

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Option 1:** Add 4th oven deck

  - Cost: \~\$6,000 for additional deck + installation

  - Benefit: +33% capacity (increases max to 32 loaves/cycle)

  - Challenge: Requires more electrical capacity (already near panel
    limit)

- **Option 2:** Add second oven

  - Cost: \~\$18,000+ for second 2-3 deck oven

  - Benefit: Doubles capacity, provides redundancy

  - Challenge: Space constraint (would need to reconfigure BOH layout)

- **Option 3:** Extend hours (earlier start)

  - Cost: Minimal (no equipment)

  - Benefit: +2-3 additional bake cycles possible

  - Challenge: Staff burnout (already 4:00 AM start), quality of life
    for Marcus

- **Current Strategy:** Accept capacity limitation, maintain quality
  over volume

**SECONDARY BOTTLENECK: Retarder Capacity**

**Current State:**

- 36-pan retarder capacity = \~200 loaves maximum overnight cold proof

- **Saturday production requires:** 220-240 loaves (exceeds capacity)

**Current Workaround:**

- Some Friday night shaped loaves proof at room temp for 3-4 hours, then
  baked late Friday night

- These loaves sold Saturday morning (12-18 hour old, not ideal)

- **Quality trade-off accepted** to meet weekend demand

**Future Mitigation:**

- Add second retarder unit: \$1,500-2,500

- This is planned investment for Year 3 (2026)

**TERTIARY BOTTLENECK: Cooling Rack Space**

**Current State:**

- 4 cooling racks x 20 pans = 80 pan positions

- Each loaf needs \~3 hours cooling minimum

- **Saturday morning (peak):** All 80 positions occupied by 9:00 AM

**Implications:**

- Cannot continue baking until racks clear (space opens)

- Creates forced pause in production mid-morning

- Some loaves cooled on sheet pans on counters (non-ideal, takes bench
  space)

**Mitigation:**

- Purchase 2 additional cooling racks: \$370 total

- This is planned for Q1 2026

- Alternative: Faster rotation to packaging (start packaging at 2 hours
  for some products)

**6.2 Timing Dependencies (Critical Path Issues)**

**DEPENDENCY #1: Starter Health → Entire Sourdough Production**

**Critical Path:**

- If starter is weak/sluggish → Levain build takes 10-12 hours instead
  of 6-8

- **Delay consequence:** Cannot mix sourdough on schedule

- **Cascade effect:**

  - Delayed mix → Delayed bulk fermentation → Delayed shaping

  - Delayed shaping → Late loading into retarder (or skipped cold proof)

  - Late retarder load → Late morning bake → Late availability in retail
    display

  - **Revenue impact:** \$400-800 lost (morning customers buy elsewhere)

**Root Causes of Weak Starter:**

- Temperature fluctuations (walk-in cooler malfunction)

- Missed feeding (human error on Monday prep)

- Old starter (needs \"refreshing\" with multiple feedings)

**Preventive Measures:**

- **Daily starter assessment:** Marcus visually inspects every morning

- **Backup starter:** Small emergency starter kept separately (insurance
  policy)

- **Temperature monitoring:** Walk-in cooler has high-temp alarm

- **Training:** Rachel and David trained on starter maintenance
  (redundancy)

**DEPENDENCY #2: Bulk Fermentation Timing → Shaping Window**

**Critical Path:**

- Sourdough bulk fermentation is 4-6 hours (temperature-dependent)

- **Shaping window:** Dough must be shaped when bulk fermentation is
  complete

- **Cannot delay:** Over-fermented dough collapses, becomes unusable

- **Cannot rush:** Under-fermented dough won\'t develop flavor,
  structure

**Challenge:**

- Marcus and Rachel must be available for shaping at the moment bulk
  fermentation completes

- **If both are busy with other tasks (e.g., wholesale delivery,
  equipment issue), shaping is delayed**

- Over-proofed dough = wasted batch (up to 50 kg dough = \$80 ingredient
  loss + lost revenue)

**Mitigation:**

- **Stagger mix times:** Country batch 1 at 6:00 AM, batch 2 at 7:00 AM
  (shaping windows separated)

- **Temperature control:** Use cooler area for slower fermentation (buys
  time flexibility)

- **Visual monitoring:** Check dough every 30 min once 3 hours elapsed
  (anticipate completion)

- **Team backup:** David trained to assist with shaping if Marcus/Rachel
  unavailable

**DEPENDENCY #3: Cold Proof Duration → Morning Bake Quality**

**Critical Path:**

- Loaves shaped in evening (6:00-8:00 PM) → Load into retarder → Cold
  proof overnight → Bake next morning (5:00 AM)

- **Ideal cold proof:** 10-12 hours at 40°F

- **Too short (\< 8 hours):** Under-proofed, won\'t rise properly in
  oven (dense crumb)

- **Too long (\> 16 hours):** Over-proofed, collapses in oven (flat
  loaves)

**Potential Disruptions:**

- **Late shaping:** If shaping finishes at 9:00 PM instead of 8:00 PM →
  Only 8 hours cold proof → Under-proofed

  - **Consequence:** Loaves must be pulled early from retarder, allowed
    to warm up/proof longer (delays bake)

- **Retarder malfunction:** If temperature rises above 45°F,
  fermentation accelerates

  - **Consequence:** Over-proofed loaves (must discard or repurpose for
    breadcrumbs/stuffing)

**Mitigation:**

- **Strict shaping schedule:** 12:00-2:00 PM window for next-day
  production (non-negotiable)

- **Retarder alarm:** Temperature alarm alerts if above 42°F

- **Backup plan:** If late shaping occurs, adjust morning bake schedule
  (bake under-proofed loaves last, allow warming time)

**DEPENDENCY #4: Oven Temperature Recovery → Bake Scheduling**

**Critical Path:**

- Oven requires 10-15 minutes between bakes to recover temperature after
  cold dough loaded

- **If next batch loaded too soon:** Oven temperature too low → Poor
  oven spring → Dense loaves, pale crust

- **If wait too long:** Idle time → Productivity loss → Cannot complete
  all bakes by closing

**Saturday Challenge:**

- 14 bake cycles needed (see section 4.3)

- **Total oven time:** 11+ hours

- **Zero tolerance for delays:** Any 15-minute setback means 1 bake
  cycle lost

- **Lost cycle = 25-30 loaves not produced = \$180-225 revenue loss**

**Mitigation:**

- **Strict timer discipline:** Marcus uses multiple timers, cannot be
  distracted

- **Pre-staging:** Next batch always prepped and ready before current
  bake completes (no downtime)

- **Temperature monitoring:** Quick visual check of oven temp between
  loads (handheld IR thermometer)

- **Sequence optimization:** Strategic ordering of bakes (high-temp
  breads first, enriched breads during cooldown periods)

**6.3 Quality Control Points**

**QC CHECKPOINT #1: Dough Temperature (DDT - Desired Dough
Temperature)**

**Target:** 76-78°F after final mix

**Why Critical:**

- Dough temperature directly controls fermentation speed

- **Too cold (\< 72°F):** Sluggish fermentation, extended bulk time
  (schedule delays)

- **Too warm (\> 82°F):** Rapid fermentation, risk of over-proofing, off
  flavors (acetic vs. lactic acid balance shifts)

**Monitoring:**

- **Thermometer used:** Instant-read digital, \$25 ThermoWorks model

- **When checked:** Immediately after mixing complete (before transfer
  to fermentation tub)

- **Frequency:** Every batch (100% inspection)

- **Corrective action if out of range:**

  - Too cold: Place tub near oven or warm area (ambient temp boost)

  - Too warm: Place tub in cooler area or briefly in walk-in (drop temp)

**Root Cause Prevention:**

- **Water temperature calculation:** Marcus calculates required water
  temp before each mix

  - Formula: Desired DDT x 3 - (Room Temp + Flour Temp + Friction
    Factor) = Water Temp

  - **Example:** Target 76°F, Room 70°F, Flour 68°F, Friction Factor
    22°F → Water temp = 76x3 - (70+68+22) = 228 - 160 = 68°F

  - **FLAG: ASSUMED** friction factor based on typical spiral mixer
    (varies by model)

**QC CHECKPOINT #2: Bulk Fermentation Completion**

**Visual/Tactile Indicators:**

- 75-100% volume increase (marked on tub)

- Domed surface (not flat or collapsed)

- Visible bubbles on surface and through sides of clear tub

- **\"Wobble test\":** Tub shaken gently, dough jiggles (indicates gas
  retention)

- **Poke test:** Finger pressed into dough, indentation slowly springs
  back halfway

**Why Critical:**

- Under-fermented: Dense crumb, poor flavor, loaf won\'t rise in oven

- Over-fermented: Dough collapses, sour flavor, gummy texture

**Monitoring:**

- **Who:** Marcus or Rachel (experienced eye required)

- **When:** Every 30 min once 3 hours elapsed

- **Decision:** \"Go/No-Go\" for shaping

**Common Issues:**

- **Uneven fermentation:** Top of dough more active than bottom

  - **Cause:** Poor mixing, temperature gradient in room

  - **Corrective action:** Perform additional fold to redistribute heat
    and gases

- **Slow fermentation:** Still flat after 6 hours

  - **Cause:** Weak starter, cold dough temp, low ambient temp

  - **Corrective action:** Extend bulk time, move to warmer location

**QC CHECKPOINT #3: Final Proof Readiness (Pre-Bake)**

**Poke Test Protocol:**

- Finger pressed gently into dough (1/2 inch depth)

- **Under-proofed:** Springs back quickly and completely

- **Properly proofed:** Springs back slowly, halfway (indentation
  remains slightly visible)

- **Over-proofed:** Does not spring back, indentation remains or
  collapses

**Why Critical:**

- Under-proofed: Loaf will have tight crumb, tear/rupture in oven
  (uncontrolled burst)

- Properly proofed: Maximum oven spring, optimal open crumb, clean score
  marks

- Over-proofed: Loaf collapses in oven (flat), gummy texture, off
  flavors

**Monitoring:**

- **Who:** Marcus (100% of loaves assessed before scoring)

- **When:** Just before loading into oven (cold-retarded loaves pulled
  15 min prior to assess)

- **Decision:** Bake immediately, delay, or discard

**Challenge with Cold Proof:**

- Cold-retarded loaves come from retarder at 40°F

- **Poke test unreliable on cold dough** (false \"under-proofed\"
  reading)

- **Solution:** Allow 10-15 min at room temp, re-assess (dough warms
  slightly, gives true reading)

**Corrective Action:**

- **Under-proofed:** Delay bake, allow 20-30 min additional proof at
  room temp

- **Over-proofed:** Bake immediately (cannot reverse), lower oven temp
  slightly (reduce oven spring demand), accept lower quality

**QC CHECKPOINT #4: Bake Completion Assessment**

**Visual Indicators:**

- **Crust color:** Deep golden-brown to dark brown (product-specific)

  - Country Sourdough: Rich mahogany brown

  - Rye: Very dark brown (darker than wheat breads)

  - Baguette: Golden with blistered crust

- **Score marks:** \"Ear\" formation (raised edge along score), clean
  opening (not torn)

- **Shape:** Even rise, no flat sides or collapsed areas

**Auditory Indicator:**

- **Hollow sound:** Tap bottom of loaf, should produce hollow \"thump\"

  - Solid thud = under-baked (doughy interior)

**Temperature Check:**

- **Internal temp:** Instant-read thermometer inserted into center

  - Lean breads (sourdough, baguette): 205-210°F

  - Enriched breads (sandwich loaf): 200-205°F (lower due to fat
    content)

  - Rye breads: 205-207°F

**Why Critical:**

- Under-baked: Gummy interior, poor shelf life (spoils faster),
  unpleasant texture

- Over-baked: Excessively thick crust, dry crumb, burnt flavor

**Monitoring:**

- **Who:** Marcus or David (responsible for oven)

- **When:** End of bake cycle (timer goes off)

- **Frequency:** Visual on 100% of loaves, temp check on 2-3 loaves per
  batch (sample)

**Corrective Action:**

- **If under-baked (caught early):** Return to oven for 5-10 min
  additional time

- **If under-baked (post-cooling):** Mark for staff consumption or
  donation (cannot sell)

- **If over-baked:** Assess severity

  - Slightly over: Sell at discount (\"rustic\" style)

  - Severely over: Repurpose (breadcrumbs, croutons) or discard

**QC CHECKPOINT #5: Post-Bake Cooling and Packaging**

**Cooling Protocol:**

- **Minimum time:** Product-specific (see section 4.1)

  - Baguettes: 30-45 min

  - Sourdough: 3 hours

  - Whole grain/rye: 4-6 hours

- **Touch test:** Loaf should be barely warm or room temperature before
  packaging

**Why Critical:**

- Packaging hot bread: Trapped steam condenses, makes crust soggy,
  promotes mold growth

- Result: Reduced shelf life (spoils in 1 day instead of 3 days)

**Monitoring:**

- **Who:** Sarah (FOH) or David

- **When:** Before packaging for sale

- **Rule:** \"If in doubt, wait another hour\"

**Common Mistake:**

- Rushing to package during busy retail period (customers want fresh
  bread immediately)

- **Consequence:** Customer complaints about soggy bread, mold growth

- **Prevention:** Clear communication to customers (\"This loaf just
  came out! It\'ll be perfect in 2 hours, or you can take it warm and
  keep the bag open until it cools\")

**6.4 Waste and Shrinkage Factors**

**INGREDIENT WASTE:**

**Flour Waste:**

- **Sources:**

  - Dusting benches, bannetons (necessary for production, not waste)

  - Spills during scaling/pouring (human error)

  - Torn bags (occasional)

- **Typical rate:** 2-3% of flour purchased

  - Annual flour: \~30,000 kg

  - Annual waste: 600-900 kg (not usable in bread)

  - **Cost:** \$525-788/year

**Mitigation:**

- Use bench flour in levain feeds (recapture)

- Train staff on careful handling

- Proper storage (sealed containers, dry conditions)

**Starter Discard:**

- **Daily discard:** 200g/day x 6 days = 1.2 kg/week = \~60 kg/year

- **Cost:** \~\$53/year (minimal)

- **Not true waste:** Some used for experiments, crackers, or home
  baking by staff

**PRODUCTION WASTE (Unsold Finished Product):**

**Daily Spoilage Rate:**

- **Target:** \< 3% of production (industry best practice)

- **Current:** 5-7% average (typical for quality-focused artisan bakery)

- **Breakdown by cause:**

  - Production error (under-baked, over-baked, cosmetic defects): 2%

  - Unsold inventory (over-production): 3-5%

  - Damage during handling: \< 1%

**Weekly Waste Calculation:**

- **Production:** 1,190 loaves + 255 baguettes = 1,445 units

- **Waste at 6%:** 87 units/week

- **Cost per unit (average):** \$3.40 ingredient cost

- **Weekly waste cost:** \$296

- **Annual waste cost:** \$15,392

**Impact on Profitability:**

- 6% waste = 6% of COGS wasted

- On \$80,760 annual COGS, waste = \$4,846 annually

- **This is \~1.1% of gross revenue** (manageable but not ideal)

**Waste Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. Accurate Sales Forecasting:**

- **Method:** Track daily sales by product for 12+ weeks

- **Identify patterns:**

  - Rainy days = lower foot traffic, reduce production by 10%

  - First week of month (payday) = higher sales

  - Saturdays consistently highest (plan accordingly)

- **Adjust production:** Fine-tune daily quantities based on historical
  data

- **Current challenge:** Only 2.5 years of data, still learning seasonal
  patterns

**2. Day-Old Bread Protocol:**

- **Day-old bread policy:**

  - 30% discount (e.g., \$9 sourdough → \$6.30 day-old)

  - Clearly labeled \"Baked Yesterday\"

  - Sold in dedicated section of display case

- **Typical day-old volume:** 15-25 loaves/day (from previous day\'s
  unsold)

- **Day-old revenue:** \$90-150/day (better than zero)

**3. Donation Program:**

- **Partnership:** Local food bank (Mapleton Community Kitchen)

- **Schedule:** Tuesday & Friday pickups

- **Volume:** 30-50 loaves/week donated

- **Tax benefit:** Itemized deduction at fair market value (\~\$350/week
  = \$18,000/year)

- **FLAG: ASSUMED** - Tax treatment per IRS guidelines on food donation

**4. Staff Purchase Program:**

- **Discount:** 50% off for employees (end-of-day purchases)

- **Usage:** Staff buy imperfect loaves, slightly over-baked, etc.

- **Benefit:** Reduces waste, provides perk for employees

**5. Repurposing:**

- **Breadcrumbs:** Severely over-baked or very stale bread processed
  into breadcrumbs

  - Packaged in 8oz bags, sold for \$3.50/bag

  - \~5 loaves/week repurposed → 3-4 bags → \$10-14 recovered revenue

- **Croutons:** Cubed day-old bread, seasoned, baked

  - Sold in FOH for \$4.50/bag (6oz)

  - Popular salad topping, \~8 bags/week sold

**SHRINKAGE (Theft/Unexplained Loss):**

**Monitoring:**

- **Daily inventory count:** Sarah counts all loaves in FOH at end of
  shift, compares to POS sales

- **Expected:** POS sales + day-old inventory + damaged/donated = total
  production

- **Shrinkage:** Unexplained difference

**Current Shrinkage Rate:** \~0.5% of production

- **Weekly:** 7-8 loaves unaccounted for

- **Annual cost:** \~\$4,500 (retail value)

**Sources:**

- **Customer theft:** Rare (small space, visible counter, difficult to
  conceal loaf)

- **Staff consumption:** Tasting for quality control, small pieces for
  personal consumption (tolerated)

- **Counting errors:** Most likely cause (human error in daily count)

**Acceptable Loss:**

- **Industry standard:** 1-2% shrinkage is normal

- **Parkside at 0.5%:** Well-controlled, not a concern

**6.5 What Happens When Things Go Wrong (Failure Scenarios)**

**SCENARIO #1: Oven Failure (Mid-Saturday)**

**Event:** Oven stops heating at 9:00 AM, Saturday (peak production day)

- **Production status:** 75 Country Sourdough baked, 60 more loaves
  shaped and cold-proofed (not yet baked)

- **Remaining bakes:** Whole Grain, Multigrain, Baguettes, Specialty
  loaves all unproduced

**Immediate Impact:**

- **Lost production:** 175 loaves + 50 baguettes = \~\$1,700 revenue

- **Wasted COGS:** Shaped dough cannot be saved (over-proofs waiting for
  repair) = \~\$280 ingredient loss

- **Customer dissatisfaction:** Regular Saturday customers arrive, find
  empty shelves (brand damage)

**Response Protocol:**

1.  **Assess repair timeline:**

    - Call equipment service company (response time: 2-4 hours on
      weekend)

    - If repairable same-day: Hold cold-proofed dough in retarder (buys
      a few hours)

    - If multi-day repair: Dough is lost (will over-proof)

2.  **Customer communication:**

    - Post on Instagram/Facebook immediately: \"Equipment issue today,
      limited selection available\"

    - Update website: \"Saturday hours adjusted\"

    - Sarah makes calls to wholesale accounts: \"Cannot fulfill orders
      today\"

3.  **Wholesale order management:**

    - **Priority:** Long-term wholesale partners get available inventory
      first

    - Offer credit/makeup delivery on Tuesday

4.  **Dough repurposing (if overnight repair):**

    - Over-proofed dough can sometimes be re-worked:

      - Knock back, re-shape, proof again (quality suffers, but salvages
        some value)

      - Or donate entire batch to food bank immediately (tax write-off)

5.  **Revenue recovery:**

    - **Sunday:** Ramp up production to 130% of normal (extra shift
      hours)

    - **Tuesday:** Offer \"Welcome Back\" promotion (10% off to
      apologize for Saturday)

**Cost of Event:**

- Lost revenue: \$1,700

- Wasted COGS: \$280

- Emergency repair: \$500-800 (weekend service call + parts)

- Staff overtime (Sunday makeup): \$200

- **Total impact:** \~\$2,680-3,000

**Prevention/Mitigation:**

- **Quarterly preventive maintenance:** Service call every 3 months
  (\$180/visit) to catch issues early

- **Equipment reserve fund:** \$150/month saved for emergency repairs
  (annual \$1,800 reserve)

- **Backup plan:** Identify nearby commercial kitchen (shared kitchen
  space) that could be rented in emergency

  - **FLAG: NOT CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED** - This is a gap in current
    business continuity plan

**SCENARIO #2: Refrigeration Failure (Overnight)**

**Event:** Walk-in cooler compressor fails at 11:00 PM Friday night,
temperature rises to 65°F by morning

- **Contents affected:**

  - 150 cold-proofed loaves in bannetons (Country, Whole Grain,
    Multigrain)

  - 200 lbs dairy (milk, butter)

  - 80 kg flour in storage

  - Wholesale orders (pre-packed)

**Immediate Impact:**

- **Over-proofed dough:** All 150 loaves in retarder have continued
  fermenting at warm temp (8 hours at 65°F)

  - Loaves are likely over-proofed, may collapse if baked

  - **Estimated loss:** 150 loaves x \$2.00 COGS = \$300 + lost revenue
    \~\$1,200

- **Dairy spoilage:** Milk and butter at 65°F for 8 hours

  - **FDA food safety:** Perishables above 40°F for \>2 hours must be
    discarded

  - **Loss:** \$150 dairy value

- **Flour:** Unaffected (dry good, temperature insensitive)

**Response Protocol:**

1.  **4:00 AM Discovery (Marcus arrival):**

    - Notice warm temperature on walk-in door display

    - Immediately assess dough (poke test all loaves)

    - Call refrigeration repair service (24-hour emergency line)

2.  **Dough triage:**

    - **Salvageable:** Some loaves may be usable if caught early

      - Bake immediately (no additional proof needed)

      - Shape may be flat, quality degraded (sell at discount or donate)

    - **Lost:** Collapsed dough discarded (compost)

3.  **Dairy disposal:**

    - **All dairy discarded** (food safety protocol, cannot risk)

    - Emergency purchase: Marcus drives to restaurant supply store
      (opens 6:00 AM)

    - Purchase 20 lbs butter, 10 gallons milk (enough for day\'s
      sandwich loaves)

    - **Cost:** \~\$175 emergency purchase (higher than wholesale)

4.  **Production adjustment:**

    - **No sourdough production Saturday** (starter was in walk-in, may
      be affected)

    - Focus on: Baguettes, Focaccia (minimal cold storage needed)

    - Ramp up baguette production to 75 (vs. 50) to compensate for lost
      sourdough revenue

5.  **Customer communication:**

    - Sign in store: \"Limited sourdough today due to equipment issue\"

    - Instagram post: \"Today\'s special: Extra baguettes!\"

    - Frame positively (not apologetic) - customers appreciate
      transparency

**Cost of Event:**

- Lost sourdough production: \~\$1,050 revenue (wholesale + retail)

- Wasted COGS (dough): \$510

- Dairy disposal: \$255

- Emergency dairy purchase: \$298

- Refrigeration repair: \$600-1,200 (compressor replacement)

- **Total impact:** \~\$2,663-3,263

**Prevention/Mitigation:**

- **Temperature alarm system:**

  - **Currently:** Walk-in has audible alarm (sounds if temp \> 45°F)

  - **Gap:** Alarm only audible in bakery (no remote alert)

  - **Recommended upgrade:** Internet-connected sensor with SMS alerts
    to Marcus\'s phone

  - **Cost:** \$150-250 (worth it for peace of mind)

- **Insurance:** Equipment breakdown insurance covers major repairs
  (Parkside has this)

**SCENARIO #3: Staff No-Show (Critical Position)**

**Event:** Rachel (Production Baker) calls in sick at 3:30 AM Saturday
(stomach flu, cannot work)

- **Impact:** Rachel handles 80% of mixing, all baguette shaping,
  assists with bulk fermentation folds

- **Saturday production target:** 250 loaves (peak day)

**Immediate Impact:**

- **Cannot produce at full volume** with Marcus alone

- **Estimated production:** 60-70% of normal (150-175 loaves)

- **Lost revenue:** \~\$600-700

**Response Protocol:**

1.  **3:30 AM - Marcus receives call:**

    - Assess: Can David arrive earlier? (Call David at 3:35 AM)

    - David available: Yes, can arrive by 4:30 AM (1 hour earlier than
      normal)

2.  **Revised Production Plan:**

    - **Eliminate:** Specialty breads (Olive & Rosemary, Rye) - skip for
      the day

    - **Reduce:** Multigrain from 30 to 15 loaves

    - **Maintain:** Country Sourdough (customer expectation), Baguettes
      (high demand)

    - **New target:** 180 loaves (vs. 250)

3.  **Task reallocation:**

    - **Marcus:** Focus on mixing, oven management (cannot be delegated)

    - **David (4:30 AM arrival):** Bulk fermentation folds, baguette
      shaping (trained backup)

    - **Trade-off:** Baguette quality may be lower (David less
      experienced), acceptable for emergency

4.  **Customer management:**

    - **Expectation:** Many customers will arrive expecting full
      selection, won\'t find it

    - **Sarah (FOH):** Brief each customer: \"Short-staffed today,
      limited selection, apologies\"

    - **Discount strategy:** Offer 10% off all purchases as apology
      (goodwill gesture)

    - **Social media:** NO public post (don\'t advertise weakness,
      handle in-store quietly)

5.  **Sunday prep:**

    - **Problem:** Rachel typically shapes Sunday\'s loaves on Saturday
      afternoon (retard overnight)

    - **Solution:** Marcus and David stay late Saturday (until 3:00 PM)
      to shape Sunday\'s loaves

    - **Overtime cost:** David\'s OT (3 hours x \$27/hr time-and-a-half)
      = \$81

**Cost of Event:**

- Lost revenue: \$600-700 (estimate)

- Overtime for David: \$81

- 10% discount (goodwill): \~\$180 (10% of Saturday retail sales)

- **Total impact:** \~\$861-961

**Prevention/Mitigation:**

- **Cross-training:** Critical (David can cover 70% of Rachel\'s
  responsibilities)

  - **Ongoing:** Weekly skill-building (David practices baguette shaping
    each Thursday)

- **Backup labor pool:**

  - **Gap:** No on-call part-time baker currently

  - **Recommendation:** Establish relationship with 1-2 experienced
    local bakers (freelance) who can be called for emergency shifts

  - **Cost:** \$25/hr for experienced backup (premium for short notice)

- **Sick day policy:**

  - Staff required to call by 3:00 AM if unable to work (gives Marcus 1
    hour to adjust plan)

  - Paid sick days (3 per year) to incentivize early notification (not
    calling out at last second)

**SCENARIO #4: Major Ingredient Shortage (Flour Delivery Delayed)**

**Event:** Tuesday morning, regular flour delivery truck breaks down en
route, delivery delayed 3 days

- **Current flour inventory:** 80 kg bread flour, 20 kg whole wheat
  (enough for 1 day)

- **Weekly flour need:** 623 kg

- **Impact:** Cannot produce Wed-Thu-Fri without flour

**Immediate Impact:**

- **Lost production:** 3 days = \~550 loaves

- **Lost revenue:** \~\$3,900

- **Wholesale orders:** Cannot fulfill (breach of informal agreements)

**Response Protocol:**

1.  **Tuesday 8:00 AM - Discovery:**

    - Distributor calls: \"Truck issue, cannot deliver until Friday\"

    - Marcus evaluates options

2.  **Emergency sourcing:**

    - **Option A:** Purchase from local restaurant supply store

      - **Available:** 200 kg (enough for 2 days)

- **Cost:** \$2.38/kg (vs. \$1.28/kg wholesale) - 86% markup

  - **Total emergency cost:** 200 x \$2.38 = \$476 (vs. \$256 normal) =
    **\$220 premium**

  - **Option B:** Borrow from nearby bakery (if willing)

    - Call colleague at bakery 8 miles away

    - Offer to reciprocate in future

    - **Available:** 100 kg (enough for 1 day)

  - **Option C:** Reduce production, prioritize high-margin items

    - Focus on: Focaccia (low flour per portion), Baguettes (fast
      turnover)

    - Skip: Sandwich loaves (high flour usage, lower margin)

3.  **Chosen strategy: Combination**

    - **Tuesday:** Use existing 100 kg, produce normal volume

    - **Wednesday:** Purchase 200 kg from restaurant supply, borrow 100
      kg from colleague

    - **Thursday:** Purchase another 200 kg from restaurant supply

    - **Friday:** Regular delivery arrives (resume normal operations)

4.  **Customer communication:**

    - **Wholesale:** Call partners Wed AM: \"Limited availability
      Wed-Thu, full orders resume Friday\"

    - **Retail:** Signage: \"Limited selection Wed-Thu - thank you for
      your patience\"

5.  **Financial impact:**

    - Emergency flour purchases: \$952 (vs. \$512 normal) = **\$440
      premium**

    - Reduced wholesale fulfillment: \~\$400 lost revenue (orders
      delayed)

- **Total impact:** \~\$840

**Prevention/Mitigation:**

- **Larger flour inventory:** Increase base inventory from 80 kg to 200
  kg (covers 2-3 days)

  - **Trade-off:** More storage space needed, slight quality degradation
    with age

  - **Cost:** No additional cost (just order more per delivery)

- **Backup supplier:** Establish relationship with second distributor
  (alternative source)

  - **Currently:** Single-source dependency (risk)

  - **Recommendation:** Add secondary supplier, use for 20% of orders
    (maintain relationship)

**SCENARIO #5: Health Department Inspection (Unannounced)**

**Event:** Wednesday 10:00 AM, Health Department inspector arrives
(routine annual inspection)

- **Required:** Immediate pause of production, walk-through inspection,
  review of records

**Immediate Impact:**

- **Production halt:** All food prep stops during inspection (1-2 hours)

- **Lost time:** Cannot complete 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM tasks (ciabatta
  shaping, sandwich loaf bake)

- **If violations found:** Potential fines, mandatory corrective
  actions, follow-up inspection

**Response Protocol:**

1.  **10:00 AM - Inspector arrives:**

    - Marcus greets inspector, provides requested documentation:

      - Food safety certification (ServSafe, current)

      - Temperature logs (refrigeration, oven)

      - Supplier invoices (trace ingredients)

    - Production staff pauses all work, steps away from benches

2.  **Inspection focus areas:**

    - **Food storage:** Walk-in temps (should be \< 40°F), labeling,
      FIFO (first in, first out)

    - **Cross-contamination:** Separate areas for raw/cooked,
      handwashing stations functional

    - **Personal hygiene:** Staff wearing hairnets, clean aprons, no
      jewelry

    - **Cleaning protocols:** Sanitizer concentration (test strips),
      3-compartment sink setup

    - **Pest control:** No evidence of rodents, insects (traps in place,
      bait stations)

3.  **Typical findings (minor violations common):**

    - **Example:** 1 mis-labeled container (date missing on bulk flour)

    - **Example:** Handwashing sign not visible at one station

    - **Corrective action:** Immediate

<!-- -->

4.  **Inspection outcome scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Pass with Minor Violations**

- **Rating:** 95/100 points (excellent)

- **Action:** Correct minor issues immediately during inspection

- **Follow-up:** None required

- **Impact:** 2-hour production delay, resume at 12:00 PM

- **Cost:** Minimal (lost productivity \~\$150)

**Scenario B: Pass with Major Violations**

- **Rating:** 75/100 points (marginal)

- **Example violations:**

  - Refrigerator temp at 44°F (above 40°F limit)

  - Missing HACCP plan documentation

  - Improper cooling procedure for one product

- **Action:** Written corrective action plan required (submitted within
  14 days)

- **Follow-up:** Re-inspection in 30 days (\$150 fee)

- **Impact:** 2-hour delay + administrative burden (10 hours Marcus\'s
  time)

- **Cost:** \$150 re-inspection + \$400 labor (Marcus time) = \$550

**Scenario C: Fail (Critical Violations)**

- **Rating:** \<70/100 points

- **Example violations:**

  - Evidence of rodent activity

  - No hot water in handwashing station

  - Serious food safety violation (e.g., raw meat stored above
    ready-to-eat food)

- **Action:** IMMEDIATE CLOSURE until violations corrected

- **Follow-up:** Re-inspection required to reopen (within 24-48 hours)

- **Impact:** Lost revenue for 1-2 days (\~\$2,500-5,000)

- **Cost:** Extreme (potential business-ending if prolonged)

5.  **Best practices for inspection readiness:**

    - **Daily self-audits:** Rachel performs 5-minute checklist each
      morning

      - Temps logged

      - Labels checked

      - Cleaning supplies stocked

    - **Mock inspections:** Quarterly, Marcus does full walk-through
      (uses official inspection form)

    - **Staff training:** Annual food safety refresher (all staff
      ServSafe certified)

    - **Documentation:** All logs kept for 1 year (proves historical
      compliance)

**Prevention/Mitigation:**

- **Current status:** Parkside has excellent track record (last 2
  inspections: 96, 98 scores)

- **Key success factor:** Marcus\'s experience (knows what inspectors
  look for)

- **Insurance:** General liability insurance includes some coverage for
  health department issues

**SCENARIO #6: Key Employee Resignation (Rachel Gives 2-Week Notice)**

**Event:** Rachel announces she\'s moving out of state in 3 weeks, last
day will be Friday, 3 weeks from now

**Immediate Impact:**

- **Loss of primary production baker** (handles 60% of hands-on
  production)

- **Institutional knowledge loss:** Rachel knows all recipes by heart,
  troubleshoots dough issues

- **Timeline pressure:** 3 weeks to hire and train replacement (tight)

**Response Protocol:**

**Week 1: Assess and Recruit**

1.  **Day 1 (Rachel\'s notice):**

    - Marcus meets with Rachel: Understand reason (can anything change
      her mind? No - spouse\'s job transfer)

    - Discuss transition plan: Rachel agrees to help train replacement

2.  **Day 2-3: Job posting:**

    - Post to local job boards:

      - Indeed, Craigslist, local culinary school job board

    - **Requirements:**

      - 2+ years professional baking experience

      - Sourdough experience preferred

      - Available 4:30 AM start time

      - Physical stamina (lifting 50 lbs, standing 8+ hours)

    - **Compensation:** \$19.50-21.00/hour (match or exceed Rachel\'s
      rate to attract talent)

    - **Response:** Expect 10-15 applications over 5 days

3.  **Day 4-7: Screen and interview:**

    - Phone screen top 5 candidates

    - In-person working interview with top 3:

      - Candidate comes in for 4-hour paid trial shift

      - Works alongside Rachel, shapes dough, demonstrates skills

      - Marcus assesses: technique, speed, cultural fit, reliability

    - Select top candidate, make offer

**Week 2: Onboarding and Training**

1.  **New hire: Emma (selected candidate):**

    - Experience: 3 years at wholesale bakery, sourdough production

    - Start date: Monday of Week 2 (overlaps 2 weeks with Rachel)

    - Rate: \$20.00/hour

2.  **Training structure:**

    - **Week 2:** Emma shadows Rachel full-time (learns workflow,
      recipes, equipment)

      - Monday-Wednesday: Observation, take notes

      - Thursday-Friday: Hands-on with Rachel supervising

    - **Documentation:** Marcus creates written SOPs for all core tasks
      (should have been done earlier)

**Week 3: Transition**

1.  **Emma takes increasing responsibility:**

    - Monday-Wednesday: Emma leads, Rachel assists/corrects

    - Thursday-Friday: Emma solo on most tasks, Rachel available for
      questions

2.  **Friday (Rachel\'s last day):**

    - Team goodbye lunch (Marcus provides)

    - Final knowledge transfer: \"Here\'s what I wish I\'d told
      you\...\"

**Week 4 and Beyond: Post-Transition**

1.  **Emma solo (with Marcus oversight):**

    - Expect reduced productivity first 2-3 weeks (learning curve)

    - Estimated efficiency: 75% of Rachel\'s speed initially

    - Adjust production targets down 10-15% temporarily

2.  **Quality monitoring:**

    - Marcus more hands-on first month (closer QC checks)

    - Expect some product inconsistency (acceptable during learning
      period)

**Cost of Event:**

- **Overlapping labor:** 2 weeks Emma + Rachel working simultaneously

  - Extra cost: \$3,200 (80 hours x \$20/hr for Emma while Rachel also
    being paid)

- **Reduced productivity:** First month post-transition

  - Lost revenue: \~\$800 (10% reduction x 4 weeks)

- **Training time:** Marcus\'s time (40 hours)

  - Opportunity cost: \$600 (Marcus not doing other tasks)

- **Total impact:** \~\$4,600

**Prevention/Mitigation:**

- **Succession planning:** Always be training backups (David should be
  80% capable of Rachel\'s role)

- **Documentation:** Written SOPs reduce dependency on individual
  knowledge

- **Competitive compensation:** Pay market rate to reduce turnover risk

- **Culture/retention:** Marcus should check in regularly with all staff
  (identify dissatisfaction early)

**Current gap:**

- **FLAG:** Parkside does not have written SOPs for all processes
  (relies on institutional knowledge)

- **Recommendation:** Marcus should document all core recipes and
  procedures (10-15 hours investment)

**APPENDIX: Summary of Critical Assumptions and Gaps**

Throughout this operational model, several assumptions were necessary
where specific data was unavailable. These are flagged for transparency:

**ASSUMED - Equipment & Facilities:**

- Rental rate (\$1.83/sq ft) based on typical suburban commercial rates

- Friction factor for mixer (22°F) based on typical spiral mixer
  performance

- Walk-in cooler temp recovery time and duty cycle percentages

**ASSUMED - Financial:**

- Organic flour percentage (60/40 blend) based on artisan bakery
  positioning

- Wholesale distributor pricing for dairy (\$2.55/liter milk, \$12.75/kg
  butter)

- Flour wholesale pricing (\$1.19-2.21/kg depending on type) reflects
  20% discount from market rates due to long-term supplier relationships

- Card transaction percentage (80% card, 20% cash)

- Seasonality revenue percentages (+15-20% peak, -10-15% slow)

- Tax treatment for food donation (IRS guidelines)

**ASSUMED - Operations:**

- Starter maintenance waste is negligible (used for experiments)

- Average transaction value (\$18.50 retail) extrapolated from product
  mix

- Customer volume (800 retail transactions/week) calculated from revenue
  ÷ transaction value

- Health department inspection cycle and scoring system

**IDENTIFIED GAPS (Current Business Vulnerabilities):**

1.  **No backup commercial kitchen identified** for emergency oven
    failure (critical gap)

2.  **No remote temperature monitoring** for walk-in cooler (SMS alerts
    recommended)

3.  **No on-call backup labor pool** established (freelance bakers for
    emergencies)

4.  **Single-source flour supplier** (should establish backup
    relationship)

5.  **No written SOPs** for core processes (institutional knowledge
    risk)

6.  **Limited equipment redundancy** (only 1 oven, 1 mixer - any failure
    is critical)

**RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

**Priority 1 (High Impact, Low Cost):**

- Establish backup supplier relationships (flour, dairy) - \$0, 5 hours
  time

- Document core recipes and SOPs - \$0, 15 hours Marcus time

- Install remote temperature monitoring - \$250 one-time + \$10/month

**Priority 2 (High Impact, Moderate Cost):**

- Purchase 2 additional cooling racks - \$370

- Build on-call baker network (2-3 contacts) - \$0, relationship
  building

- Increase base flour inventory to 200 kg - \$0, just order pattern
  change

**Priority 3 (Moderate Impact, High Cost):**

- Add 2nd retarder unit - \$1,500-2,500 (planned 2026)

- Add 4th oven deck or 2nd oven - \$6,000-18,000 (requires capital
  planning)

**CONCLUSION: Parkside Bakery as a Functioning System**

Parkside Bakery represents a mature, efficiently-run artisan bread
operation that has achieved strong financial performance (23% net profit
margin) while maintaining quality and work-life balance for its 4-person
team. The bakery\'s success is attributable to several key factors:

**Operational Strengths:**

1.  **Strategic product mix:** Balance of high-margin items (focaccia,
    specialty sourdough) with volume drivers (baguettes, sandwich
    loaves)

2.  **Cold fermentation mastery:** Effective use of retardation
    decouples production from baking, enabling manageable schedules

3.  **Lean staffing model:** 4 employees producing \$450K revenue =
    \$112K revenue per FTE (excellent productivity)

4.  **Efficient COGS:** 18.0% ingredient cost (vs. 25-35% industry
    average) through careful sourcing and minimal waste

**Current Constraints:**

1.  **Saturday oven capacity:** Operating at 95% capacity, cannot grow
    weekend sales without equipment investment

2.  **Retarder capacity:** 200-loaf limit caps production flexibility

3.  **Single points of failure:** No equipment redundancy creates
    vulnerability to breakdowns

4.  **Knowledge concentration:** Heavy reliance on Marcus\'s expertise
    and experience

**Growth Opportunities:**

1.  **Mid-week capacity:** Weekday oven utilization only 60-70%, room to
    grow wholesale accounts

2.  **Online ordering:** Currently limited, could develop subscription
    model (as seen in case study research)

3.  **Extended product line:** Wholesale-focused items (par-baked,
    frozen dough) could add revenue with existing capacity

4.  **Second location:** Proven model could be replicated (requires
    significant capital)

**Risk Mitigation Priorities:** As identified in the gaps analysis, the
most critical vulnerabilities are equipment failure scenarios and key
person dependency. The recommendations in this report provide a roadmap
for addressing these risks at modest cost.

**Realism Check:** This model represents a best-case scenario for a
small artisan bakery:

- Strong owner-operator with 15 years experience

- Favorable suburban rent

- Excellent product-market fit

- Minimal startup debt

- Efficient team with low turnover

A less experienced operator, higher rent location, or different market
conditions could easily reduce net profit margin from 23% to 10-12%
(still viable but much tighter). The financial model here should be
viewed as an aspirational target, not a guaranteed outcome.

**Simulation Utility:** This operational model provides the granular
detail necessary to build a realistic bakery simulation, including:

- Time-dependent processes (fermentation, baking, cooling)

- Resource constraints (oven capacity, retarder space, cooling racks)

- Financial sensitivity (COGS, labor, pricing)

- Failure modes and their cascading effects

- Decision points and trade-offs (quality vs. volume, retail vs.
  wholesale)

The model is comprehensive enough to simulate day-to-day operations,
test \"what-if\" scenarios (e.g., \"What if we increase Saturday
production by 20%?\"), and explore strategic decisions (e.g., \"Should
we invest in a second oven or accept capacity constraints?\").
