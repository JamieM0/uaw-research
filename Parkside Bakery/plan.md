# Plan: Creating a Realistic Small Commercial Bakery Simulation

## Phase 1: Deep Research Foundation

### Step 1.1: Initial Deep Research Query

**Tool:** Gemini Deep Research (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

**Prompt:**

```
Research small commercial bakeries (3-5 employees) that primarily produce bread. I need extremely detailed operational information to create an accurate ****simulation****.

Focus on:

BUSINESS EXAMPLES:
- Find 3-5 specific real bakeries with publicly available operational details
- Prefer bakeries with: published interviews, documented processes, public financial data, social media showing daily operations
- Geographic diversity helpful but not required

OPERATIONAL DETAILS:
- Daily production schedule (minute-by-minute if possible)
- Specific bread types produced and quantities
- Recipe scaling and batch sizes
- Equipment used (mixers, ovens, proofers, etc.) with capacities and cycle times
- Ingredient sourcing, storage, and usage rates
- Staff roles and time allocation per task

PHYSICAL LAYOUT:
- Square footage and workspace organization
- Equipment placement and workflow patterns
- Storage capacity (dry goods, refrigeration, finished product)

FINANCIAL DATA:
- Ingredient costs per unit
- Utility costs (especially electricity and gas for ovens)
- Labor costs and wage rates
- Product pricing
- Revenue per product type
- Waste rates and shrinkage

TIMING AND CONSTRAINTS:
- Proofing times for different bread types
- Baking temperatures and durations
- Cooling requirements
- Cleaning and maintenance schedules
- Start times (many bakeries start 2-4am)

REAL-WORLD COMPLICATIONS:
- How they handle running out of ingredients
- Managing oven capacity constraints
- Dealing with failed batches
- Seasonal variations
- Weekend vs weekday differences

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Present findings organized by bakery, then create a synthesis section showing common patterns and realistic ranges for all metrics.
```

**Action:** Run this research and save results to Google Drive as `bakery-research-raw.md`

### Step 1.2: Targeted Follow-up Research

**Tool:** Gemini Deep Research (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

After reviewing initial results, run focused follow-up queries on gaps. Example prompts:

**Prompt A (Equipment Specifics):**

```
Research commercial bakery equipment specifications for small operations:

- Spiral mixers: capacity range, mixing times for different dough types, power consumption
- Deck ovens vs rack ovens: loading capacity, temperature ranges, baking times, recovery time between bakes
- Proofing cabinets: capacity, temperature/humidity settings, typical proofing durations
- Work tables and cooling racks: standard sizes and capacities
- Refrigeration: walk-in vs reach-in, temperature requirements for different ingredients

For each, find: specific model examples with technical specs, realistic prices, energy usage, maintenance requirements, typical lifespan.
```

**Prompt B (Recipe and Process Details):**

```
Research commercial bread production processes and recipes:

- Standard commercial recipes for: sourdough, baguettes, whole wheat sandwich loaves, ciabatta, focaccia
- Baker's percentages and scaling
- Mixing methods and times (autolyse, bulk fermentation, etc.)
- Shaping techniques and time requirements
- Proofing schedules (including retarding)
- Baking temperatures and steam requirements
- Cooling times before packaging

Include information on how commercial bakeries batch and schedule different products throughout the day.
```

**Prompt C (Financial Reality Check):**

```
Research the financial realities of small commercial bakeries:

- Typical profit margins on bread products
- Cost breakdown: ingredients vs labor vs overhead vs utilities
- Pricing strategies (wholesale vs retail)
- Volume needed for profitability
- Common financial challenges and failure points
- Seasonal revenue variations
- Actual small bakery case studies with numbers

Find any available financial statements, business plan templates, or industry benchmarks for 3-5 employee bread bakeries.
```

**Actions:**

- Run 2-3 focused research queries based on gaps
- Save each as separate files: `bakery-equipment-specs.md`, `bakery-recipes-processes.md`, `bakery-financials.md`

## Phase 2: Research Synthesis and Validation

### Step 2.1: Create Unified Knowledge Base

**Tool:** Claude Pro

**Prompt:**

```
I've conducted deep research on small commercial bakeries. I'm providing you with multiple research documents. Your task is to synthesize this into a single, coherent, realistic operational model for a specific small commercial bakery.

[Attach all research files from Google Drive]

Create a document called "Parkside Bakery - Complete Operational Model" for a fictional but realistic 4-person bakery. Include:

1. BUSINESS PROFILE
- Location type (urban/suburban context affecting hours, customers)
- Years in operation
- Owner/operator background
- Core product line (8-12 bread types)

2. FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT
- Layout description with dimensions
- Every piece of equipment with: make/model (or realistic equivalent), capacity, cycle times, energy use
- Storage capacities for ingredients and finished goods

3. STAFF AND SCHEDULE
- Each employee: role, hours, wage, specific responsibilities
- Minute-by-minute daily schedule for each person
- Task dependencies and timing constraints

4. PRODUCTION DETAILS
- Each bread product: recipe (with baker's percentages), batch size, timing from start to packaged
- Daily production quantities per product
- Oven scheduling and capacity management
- Ingredient consumption rates

5. FINANCIALS
- Complete ingredient costs
- Pricing for each product
- Daily/weekly/monthly revenue projections
- Operating costs (utilities, rent, insurance, etc.)
- Profit margins

6. CONSTRAINTS AND COMPLICATIONS
- Equipment capacity bottlenecks
- Timing dependencies
- Quality control points
- Waste and shrinkage factors
- What happens when things go wrong

Base everything on the research. Where research has ranges, choose realistic mid-range values. Where research is silent but something is necessary, make conservative realistic assumptions and FLAG these clearly.

Output should be exhaustively detailed - err on the side of too much detail.
```

**Action:** Save output as `parkside-bakery-operational-model.md` to Google Drive

### Step 2.2: Fact-Check and Reality Test

**Tool:** Claude Pro

**Prompt:**

```
You are a consultant who has worked with dozens of small commercial bakeries. Review this operational model for "Parkside Bakery" and identify anything that seems unrealistic, inconsistent, or problematic.

[Attach parkside-bakery-operational-model.md]

Check for:

INTERNAL CONSISTENCY:
- Do the timings actually work? (If bread needs 3hrs proofing and employee starts at 4am, when was it mixed?)
- Does oven capacity support claimed daily production?
- Do ingredient purchases match consumption rates?
- Do revenues match production volumes and pricing?

REALISM:
- Are profit margins realistic for this industry?
- Are labor costs and productivity reasonable?
- Is equipment appropriate for scale?
- Are recipes and processes standard practice?

COMPLETENESS:
- What's missing that a real bakery must handle?
- Are there unmodeled complications that would significantly impact operations?

RED FLAGS:
- Anything that seems too perfect or optimistic
- Timing that seems suspiciously tight
- Costs that seem too low
- Productivity that seems too high

For each issue found:
1. Explain why it's problematic
2. Provide realistic alternative based on industry norms
3. Note confidence level (certain problem vs possible issue)

Be rigorous and skeptical - I want this to be genuinely realistic.
```

**Action:** Create `bakery-model-critique.md` and update operational model based on feedback

### Step 2.3: Cross-Reference with Research

**Tool:** Claude Pro

**Prompt:**

```
Compare the Parkside Bakery operational model against the original research sources to ensure we haven't drifted from reality.

[Attach operational model + all original research files]

For each major aspect (production volumes, timing, costs, processes):
1. Cite which research supports it
2. Note where we've made assumptions beyond research
3. Identify any contradictions between model and research
4. Flag anything in research we haven't incorporated that seems important

Create a "Research Traceability Matrix" showing:
- Model element | Supporting research | Confidence level | Assumptions made

This helps ensure we can justify every aspect of the simulation as grounded in real-world data.
```

**Action:** Save as `bakery-research-traceability.md`

## Phase 3: Simulation Conversion

### Step 3.1: Analyze and Structure Simulation Components

**Tool:**Â Claude Pro

**Prompt:**

```
I need to convert the Parkside Bakery operational model into a Universal Automation Wiki simulation.

[Attach: parkside-bakery-operational-model.md]

Your task is to analyze what needs to be represented and create a comprehensive list organized by simulation category. Do NOT create any JSON yet - this is purely conceptual analysis.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- The UAW simulation engine is data-driven and flexible
- Standard object types exist (actor, equipment, resource, product) but custom types are encouraged
- Objects have a "type" field and a "properties" object containing all their attributes
- Tasks interact with objects through "interactions" arrays that modify properties
- The system supports property_changes with delta, from/to, or set operations

ANALYZE AND LIST:

**1. CUSTOM OBJECT TYPES NEEDED:**
For a bakery, identify domain-specific types beyond the standard ones. Examples might include:
- "ingredient" (different from generic resource - has baking-specific properties)
- "dough_batch" (tracks fermentation state, temperature, batch number)
- "oven_deck" (individual deck with specific temperature, capacity)
- "storage_container" (tracks contents, capacity, temperature)
- Any other bakery-specific types that would make the simulation more realistic

For each custom type, list:
- Why it needs to be a separate type
- What properties it should have
- How it differs from standard types

**2. STANDARD OBJECTS BY TYPE:**

ACTORS (staff members):
- List each person with their key properties (role, hourly_rate, shift_start, shift_end, skills)

EQUIPMENT (persistent bakery equipment):
- List each major piece with properties (capacity, cycle_time, power_consumption, state)
- Note: Don't use generic "equipment" for everything - consider custom types for specialized items

RESOURCES (consumables that get depleted):
- Basic ingredients with units and costs
- Utilities (water, electricity, gas)
- Packaging materials

PRODUCTS (finished goods for sale):
- Each bread type with pricing and specifications

**3. PROCESSES AND INTERACTIONS:**
List every distinct activity in bread production. For each process, identify:
- What objects are involved (by ID and type)
- What properties change (quantity deltas, state transitions, temperature changes)
- Duration and timing constraints
- Dependencies on other processes

Group related processes (e.g., all "mixing" processes, all "baking" processes)

**4. TEMPORAL STRUCTURE:**
- What happens at what time of day?
- What processes run in parallel vs sequence?
- What are the critical timing constraints (can't rush fermentation)?
- Are there different day types (production day, cleaning day, delivery day)?

**5. REALISTIC COMPLICATIONS:**
Based on the operational model, identify:
- Capacity constraints (oven can only bake X loaves at once)
- Quality requirements (dough temperature must be 75-78Â°F after mixing)
- Timing dependencies (shaped dough must proof for exactly 60min before baking)
- Resource management (running low on flour triggers re-order)
- State tracking (mixer goes from clean â in-use â dirty â cleaning â clean)

**6. NOTES ON REPRESENTATION CHALLENGES:**
- What aspects of the real bakery are difficult to model in the current system?
- Where do you need to make simplifying assumptions?
- What's most critical to get right for realism?

OUTPUT: A structured markdown document organizing all this information. Be exhaustively detailed - this is the foundation for creating the actual simulation JSON.
```

**Action:**Â Save output asÂ `parkside-simulation-structure.md`

### Step 3.2A: Define All Simulation Objects (Conceptual)

**Tool:**Â Claude Pro

**Prompt:**

````
Based on the structural analysis, create a detailed specification for every object in the Parkside Bakery simulation. Do NOT create JSON yet - this is a detailed object specification document.

[Attach: parkside-simulation-structure.md, parkside-bakery-operational-model.md]

For EACH object that will exist in the simulation, provide:

**Object Specification Format:**
```

ID: [unique_identifier] Type: [object_type] Name: [human_readable_name] Emoji: [appropriate_emoji] Properties:

- property_name: [value] (unit, data type, purpose)
- property_name: [value] (unit, data type, purpose) ... Rationale: [Why this object exists, what role it plays]

```

**Categories to cover:**

1. **STAFF (type: actor):**
   - Head baker
   - Assistant bakers
   - Sales/counter person
   - Each with: hourly_rate, shift_start, shift_end, role, skill_level

2. **CUSTOM TYPE - INGREDIENT (or similar):**
   - All baking ingredients with bakery-specific properties
   - Properties might include: quantity, unit, unit_cost, optimal_storage_temp, shelf_life_days, supplier, last_delivery_date
   - Examples: bread_flour, whole_wheat_flour, yeast, salt, water, etc.

3. **CUSTOM TYPE - DOUGH_BATCH (or similar):**
   - Represents dough in various stages
   - Properties: batch_id, dough_type, weight, temperature, fermentation_start_time, fermentation_progress, state (mixed/bulk_fermenting/shaped/proofing/ready_to_bake)
   - This tracks the state transformations throughout the process

4. **CUSTOM TYPE - OVEN_DECK:**
   - Individual oven decks as separate objects
   - Properties: deck_number, current_temp, target_temp, capacity_loaves, state (heating/ready/baking/cooling), current_load, power_consumption_kw

5. **EQUIPMENT (standard type for other equipment):**
   - Spiral mixer, work tables, proofing cabinet, cooling racks, etc.
   - Properties: capacity, state, cycle_time (where relevant)

6. **PRODUCTS:**
   - Each bread type (sourdough_loaf, baguette, ciabatta, etc.)
   - Properties: quantity, sale_price, cost_per_unit, production_time_minutes, shelf_life_hours

7. **RESOURCES (generic consumables):**
   - Packaging materials, cleaning supplies
   - Utilities tracked as resources: electricity_kwh, water_gallons, gas_therms

8. **LOCATIONS (if using spatial tracking):**
   - prep_area, mixing_station, shaping_station, proofing_area, oven_area, cooling_area, storage_room, sales_counter

**KEY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Every object must have a unique ID
- All numeric properties need units specified
- Initial values should be realistic based on operational model
- Include at least 2-3 custom object types
- Think about what properties will change during tasks (those are the important ones)

Create an exhaustive, detailed specification document. Better to have too much detail than too little.

### Step 3.2B: Convert Objects to Simulation JSON

**Tool:**Â Claude Pro

**Prompt:**

````
Convert the object specifications into properly formatted UAW simulation JSON.

[Attach: parkside-objects-specification.md, example coffee shop simulation for reference]

Create the "objects" array for the simulation JSON following the UAW format exactly:

**JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "simulation": {
    "name": "Parkside Bakery - Complete Operations",
    "description": "Realistic small commercial bakery simulation based on detailed research",
    "simulation_config": {
      "start_date": "date.today"
    },
    "objects": [
      {
        "id": "unique_id",
        "type": "object_type",
        "name": "Display Name",
        "emoji": "ð¥",
        "properties": {
          "property_name": value,
          "another_property": value
        }
      }
      // ... all other objects
    ]
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. Use exact property names from the specification
2. All numeric values must be numbers, not strings
3. Include units in property names where needed (e.g., "temperature_f" or "capacity_kg")
4. Group similar objects together with comments
5. Ensure IDs are consistent and will be referenced correctly in tasks
6. Every object needs: id, type, name, emoji (optional), properties

**Order objects logically:**

1. Actors (staff)
2. Custom type 1 (e.g., ingredients)
3. Custom type 2 (e.g., dough_batches)
4. Custom type 3 (e.g., oven_decks)
5. Equipment
6. Resources
7. Products
8. Locations (if included)

Include comments in the JSON explaining groups and noting any important details.

Output ONLY the properly formatted JSON for the objects array - no explanation text outside the JSON.

````

**Action:** Save as `parkside-objects.json` and validate JSON syntax

---

### Step 3.3A: Define All Task Processes (Conceptual)
**Tool:** Claude Pro

**Prompt:**
```

Define every task/process that occurs in the Parkside Bakery operations. Do NOT create JSON yet - create a detailed process specification.

[Attach: parkside-simulation-structure.md, parkside-bakery-operational-model.md, parkside-objects-specification.md]

For EACH process/task, provide complete specifications:

**Task Specification Format:**


TASK ID: [unique_task_id]
Name: [descriptive_name]
Emoji: [task_emoji]
Performed by: [actor_id or equipment_id]
Location: [location_id if applicable]
Start Time: [HH:MM]
Duration: [minutes]
Depends On: [list of prerequisite task IDs]

Interactions:
  1. Object: [object_id] (object_type)
     Property Changes:
     - property_name: { delta: -5 } or { from: "X", to: "Y" } or { set: value }
     Rationale: [why this change happens]
  
  2. Object: [another_object_id]
     Property Changes:
     - property_name: { delta: +3 }
     Rationale: [explanation]

Realistic Constraints:
- [Any timing, capacity, or quality constraints]

Notes:
- [Any special considerations or edge cases]


**Process Categories to Define:**

**1. OPENING PROCEDURES (04:00-05:00)**

- Arrive and open facility
- Turn on equipment
- Check ingredient inventory
- Retrieve retarded dough from previous day

**2. MIXING PROCESSES (05:00-07:00)**

- Scale ingredients for each dough type
- Mix dough (different durations for different breads)
- Check dough temperature
- Begin bulk fermentation Create separate tasks for each bread type's mixing

**3. BULK FERMENTATION (passive, 2-4 hours)**

- Track dough state changes during fermentation
- May include stretch-and-fold tasks for some doughs

**4. DIVIDING AND SHAPING (07:00-09:00)**

- Divide bulk dough into individual pieces
- Pre-shape
- Bench rest
- Final shaping
- Load into proofing baskets/pans Again, separate tasks per bread type

**5. PROOFING (1-2 hours)**

- Track dough in proofing state
- Monitor until ready to bake

**6. BAKING (09:00-15:00)**

- Preheat oven decks to specific temperatures
- Score/prepare loaves
- Load specific deck
- Bake (duration varies by product)
- Unload
- Move to cooling racks Separate task for each oven load - there may be 8-12 baking tasks throughout the day

**7. COOLING AND PACKAGING (throughout afternoon)**

- Cool bread
- Package finished products
- Move to display/storage

**8. SALES (10:00-18:00)**

- Customer transactions
- Deplete product inventory
- Generate revenue

**9. CLEANING (throughout day and at closing)**

- Clean mixer after each use
- Clean work surfaces
- Sanitize proofing equipment
- End-of-day deep cleaning

**10. MAINTENANCE AND UTILITIES**

- Track electricity usage during equipment operation
- Water consumption
- Gas for ovens

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

- Every property change must be justified by real bakery operations
- Timing must be realistic and respect dependencies
- Oven capacity constraints must be enforced (can't bake more loaves than fit)
- Temperature changes must be tracked for quality
- State transitions must be logical (can't bake unshaped dough)

**DETAIL LEVEL:**Â Be exhaustively specific. A single day might have 50-100+ tasks when you include:

- Each batch of each bread type going through each stage
- Multiple oven loads
- Individual cleaning tasks
- Every state transition

Create a complete, minute-by-minute realistic task breakdown for an entire production day.

```

**Action:** Save as `parkside-tasks-specification.md`

### Step 3.3B: Convert Tasks to Simulation JSON
**Tool:** Claude Pro

**Prompt:**
````

Convert the task specifications into properly formatted UAW simulation JSON.

[Attach: parkside-tasks-specification.md, parkside-objects.json for object IDs, example coffee shop simulation]

Create the "tasks" array following UAW format exactly:

**Task JSON Format:**

```json
{
  "id": "task_unique_id",
  "emoji": "ð¥",
  "actor_id": "object_id_of_actor_or_equipment",
  "location_id": "prep_area",
  "start": "06:00",
  "duration": 20,
  "depends_on": ["prerequisite_task_id"],
  "interactions": [
    {
      "object_id": "flour_bread",
      "property_changes": {
        "quantity_kg": { "delta": -2.5 }
      }
    },
    {
      "object_id": "mixer_industrial",
      "property_changes": {
        "state": { "from": "idle", "to": "mixing" }
      }
    },
    {
      "object_id": "sourdough_batch_1",
      "property_changes": {
        "state": { "from": "ingredients_scaled", "to": "mixing" },
        "temperature_f": { "set": 78 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Interaction Types to Use:**

1. **Delta changes**Â for quantities:Â `{ "delta": -5 }`Â orÂ `{ "delta": +10 }`
2. **State transitions**Â for equipment/process states:Â `{ "from": "clean", "to": "dirty" }`
3. **Set values**Â for measurements:Â `{ "set": 350 }`Â for temperature

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. Every object_id referenced must exist in parkside-objects.json
2. Every actor_id must be a valid object ID
3. All property names must match exactly what's in the objects
4. Times must be in "HH:MM" format
5. Durations are integers (minutes)
6. Task IDs must be unique
7. depends_on must reference actual task IDs that come before this task

**Organize tasks chronologically:**

- Group by time blocks (04:00-06:00, 06:00-08:00, etc.)
- Add comments explaining each section
- Keep related tasks together

**Validation checklist before outputting:**

- [ ] All object references are valid
- [ ] All state transitions are logical (from â to makes sense)
- [ ] Time dependencies are correct (depends_on tasks happen before)
- [ ] Oven capacity isn't exceeded (can't bake 40 loaves on a 16-loaf deck)
- [ ] Quantities balance (ingredients consumed = product produced, accounting for water loss)

Output ONLY the properly formatted JSON for the tasks array with the full simulation structure.

````

**Action:** Save as `parkside-tasks.json` and validate JSON syntax

---

### Step 3.4: Create Complete Simulation with Calendar Structure
**Tool:** Claude Pro

**Prompt:**
````

Combine the objects and tasks into a complete UAW simulation JSON with calendar/day_types structure for different operational patterns.

[Attach: parkside-objects.json, parkside-tasks.json, coffee shop example showing calendar structure]

Create a complete simulation JSON that includes:

**1. SIMULATION METADATA:**

```json
{
  "simulation": {
    "name": "Parkside Bakery - Realistic Operations",
    "description": "Research-based simulation of a 4-person artisan bread bakery with detailed production processes",
    "simulation_config": {
      "start_date": "date.today"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. CALENDAR STRUCTURE:**Â Define a weekly calendar with different day types. Based on the operational model, likely includes:

- weekday_production: Normal production days (Mon-Fri or Mon-Sat)
- delivery_day: Day when ingredient deliveries arrive
- maintenance_day: Deep cleaning and equipment maintenance
- closed_day: No operations

For each day_type, include appropriate:

- Locations (may vary by day type)
- Objects (different actors, different starting quantities)
- Tasks (completely different task list)

**3. LOCATIONS (if using physical spaces):**Â Define the bakery layout with all work areas

**4. COMPLETE INTEGRATION:**Â Combine everything into a single valid JSON file following the coffee shop multi-period example structure, but with the detailed bakery objects and tasks.

**VALIDATION BEFORE OUTPUT:**

- [ ] JSON is syntactically valid
- [ ] All cross-references are correct (task references objects that exist)
- [ ] Calendar structure follows UAW format
- [ ] Day types have complete, independent definitions
- [ ] Time blocks don't overlap impossibly
- [ ] Resource flow is balanced

Output the complete simulation.json file.

````

**Action:** Save as `parkside-bakery-complete-simulation.json`

---

### Step 3.5: Validate Simulation Completeness
**Tool:** Claude Code

**Prompt:**
```

Validate the Parkside Bakery simulation JSON for completeness, correctness, and consistency.

[Attach: parkside-bakery-complete-simulation.json, parkside-bakery-operational-model.md]

Perform these checks:

**1. STRUCTURAL VALIDATION:**

- JSON is valid
- Follows UAW schema
- All required fields present
- No reserved object types used inappropriately

**2. REFERENCE VALIDATION:**

- All object IDs referenced in tasks exist
- All actor_ids are valid objects
- All depends_on task IDs exist
- All location_ids are defined

**3. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY:**

- Time sequences make sense (no tasks starting before dependencies finish)
- State transitions are valid (fromâto states are realistic)
- Oven capacity isn't exceeded (check parallel baking tasks)
- Equipment isn't double-booked (same equipment used by multiple concurrent tasks)

**4. PHYSICAL REALISM:**

- Ingredient quantities consumed â product quantities produced (accounting for 10-15% water loss in baking)
- Staff work hours are reasonable (not 18-hour shifts)
- Equipment cycle times match operational model
- Process timings match research (fermentation, proofing, baking durations)

**5. ECONOMIC CONSISTENCY:**

- Cost properties are present and realistic
- Revenue potential matches operational model targets

**6. COMPLETENESS CHECK:**Â Compare simulation against operational model:

- All staff members represented
- All equipment included
- All product types can be produced
- All major processes are modeled
- Daily production volumes achievable

Output a detailed validation report with:

- Errors (must fix)
- Warnings (should review)
- Info (things that work well)
- Comparison metrics (simulation vs operational model targets)

````

**Action:** Save report as `simulation-validation.md`, fix any errors found, re-run until clean
## Phase 4: Validation and Refinement
### Step 4.1: Simulation Consistency Check
**Tool:** Claude Pro

**Prompt:** *(Same as before, but references the correct JSON structure)*

```

Review the complete Parkside Bakery simulation for internal consistency and realism.

[Attach: parkside-bakery-complete-simulation.json, parkside-bakery-operational-model.md]

Verify:

**PHYSICAL CONSISTENCY:**

- Mass balance: Track one bread type completely through the simulation
    
    - Flour + water + other ingredients â dough (accounting for mixing)
    - Dough â baked bread (accounting for ~10% moisture loss)
    - Check: quantities balance properly with realistic yield
- Energy balance:
    
    - Sum total oven usage (deck capacity Ã baking time)
    - Compare to production volume
    - Is this realistic for the equipment described?
- Time balance:
    
    - Map out the critical path for one loaf type
    - Does timing work? (mix at 5am, bulk ferment 3hrs, shape at 8am, proof 90min, bake at 9:30am)
    - Check for timing conflicts (can baker be in two places at once?)

**FINANCIAL CONSISTENCY:**

- Calculate one day's financials:
    - Total ingredient costs (sum all consumption)
    - Total labor costs (sum all actor hours Ã hourly_rate)
    - Total utility costs (electricity, gas, water based on usage)
    - Total revenue (products produced Ã sale_price)
    - Daily profit = revenue - costs
- Compare to operational model targets
- Are margins realistic for a small bakery? (typically 5-10% net margin)

**OPERATIONAL CONSISTENCY:**

- Equipment utilization:
    - How many hours is the mixer used? (should be high in morning, lower after)
    - Oven deck usage throughout day? (should be near-continuous 9am-3pm)
    - Are there bottlenecks? (Should be! Oven capacity typically limits production)
- Staff workload:
    - Map each actor's tasks minute-by-minute
    - Any impossible gaps? (5min between tasks 10min apart?)
    - Reasonable pace? (Not sprinting constantly, some breathing room)

**PRODUCT MIX:**

- Does the simulation produce the product mix described in operational model?
- Are quantities realistic for a 4-person bakery?
- Typical commercial bakery: 150-300 loaves/day depending on size

**STATE TRANSITIONS:**

- Follow one batch of dough through all state changes:
    - ingredients_scaled â mixed â bulk_fermenting â shaped â proofing â ready_to_bake â baking â cooling â finished
- All transitions present? Realistic timing?

Create a detailed validation report with:

1. Executive summary (pass/fail for major categories)
2. Detailed findings for each check
3. Specific discrepancies with numbers
4. Recommendations for fixes
5. What's working really well

Rate overall realism on a scale of 1-10 with justification.

```

**Action:** Save as `simulation-consistency-report.md`, iterate on fixes

Compare the Parkside Bakery simulation against the real-world bakeries from the original research.

[Attach: simulation files + original research documents]

For each researched bakery, compare:
- Production volumes
- Staffing levels and costs
- Revenue and profitability
- Timing and schedules
- Equipment usage

Create a comparison table showing:
- Metric | Real Bakery 1 | Real Bakery 2 | Real Bakery 3 | Parkside Simulation | Variance

The simulation should fall within the realistic range established by research. Flag anything that's an outlier.

Also identify:
- What aspects of real bakeries we successfully captured
- What complications from real bakeries aren't modeled (and why)
- What the simulation includes that wasn't found in research (assumptions we made)

This gives us confidence that the simulation reflects reality.
```

**Action:** Save as `simulation-vs-reality-comparison.md`


### Step 4.3: Load into UAW Playground
*(Same as original, but with notes about the new structure)*

**Tool:** Manual + Claude Code (for debugging if needed)

**Steps:**
1. Load parkside-bakery-complete-simulation.json into the UAW playground
2. Select a day type (e.g., weekday_production) and run simulation
3. Observe the timeline visualization
4. Check the Live State panels for each custom object type
5. Verify financial calculations
6. Look for validation errors in the playground

**If issues found, prompt for Claude Pro:**
```

The Parkside Bakery simulation produced these runtime errors or unexpected behaviors:

[Describe specific issues, paste error messages, describe what you see vs what you expected]

[Attach: parkside-bakery-complete-simulation.json, screenshots if helpful]

The UAW simulation engine validates:

- Object reference integrity
- Task timing and dependencies
- Property change operations
- State transition validity

Diagnose the problem by:

1. Identifying which validation rule is failing
2. Explaining why the current structure violates it
3. Providing the corrected JSON segment
4. Explaining what changed and why the fix works

Focus on the minimal fix - don't rewrite large sections unless necessary.

```

**Action:** Iterate until simulation runs cleanly and visualizations look correct
### Step 4.4: Output Analysis
**Tool:** Claude Pro

**Prompt:**
```

Analyze the running Parkside Bakery simulation and evaluate realism.

[Attach: screenshots from playground, financial summary, any exported data]

**VISUALIZATION ANALYSIS:**

1. **Timeline View:**
    
    - Does the timeline look realistic? (Busy morning, consistent midday, cleanup at end)
    - Are actors working reasonable schedules or racing constantly?
    - Do parallel tasks make sense? (multiple oven decks baking simultaneously)
    - Any weird gaps or overlaps?
2. **Object State Tracking:**
    
    - Check the live state panels for each custom object type
    - Do quantities decrease/increase appropriately?
    - State transitions happening at right times?
    - Any objects stuck in impossible states?
3. **Resource Flow:**
    
    - Ingredients: Do they deplete at realistic rates?
    - Products: Do quantities accumulate appropriately?
    - Equipment states: Do they cycle clean â dirty â clean?

**NUMERICAL ANALYSIS:**

4. **Production Metrics:**
    
    - Total loaves produced per day per bread type
    - Compare to operational model targets
    - Is this achievable with the equipment and staff?
5. **Financial Performance:**
    
    - Total daily revenue
    - Total daily costs (ingredients + labor + utilities + overhead)
    - Daily profit and margin %
    - Compare to operational model projections
    - Are these numbers realistic for a small commercial bakery?
6. **Efficiency Metrics:**
    
    - Oven utilization % (time baking / total oven time available)
    - Staff utilization (productive hours / total hours)
    - Identify bottlenecks (what limits production?)

**REALISM ASSESSMENT:**

7. **What Looks Right:**
    
    - What aspects of the simulation closely match real bakery operations?
    - What details add authenticity?
8. **What's Missing:**
    
    - What real-world complications aren't represented?
    - What would make this more realistic?
    - Are there edge cases not handled?
9. **Surprises:**
    
    - Any unexpected patterns or insights?
    - Bottlenecks you didn't anticipate?
    - Inefficiencies revealed by simulation?

**COMPARISON TO RESEARCH:**

10. **Validation Against Real Bakeries:**
    - How do production volumes compare to researched bakeries?
    - Are financial metrics in the realistic range?
    - Timing and staffing similar to real operations?

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

11. **Priority Improvements:**
    - Top 3 things that would increase realism
    - What's feasible to add?
    - What level of detail is appropriate vs over-engineering?

**CONCLUSION:**

- Overall realism rating (1-10)
- Is this simulation "business-ready" for understanding bakery operations?
- What would you trust this simulation to tell you?
- What would need more validation before trusting?

2. Feasibility (can we model it in UAW?)
3. Data availability (do we have the information?)

For top 5-10 enhancements:
- Describe what's currently missing
- Explain why it matters
- Outline how it could be added
- Estimate complexity
- Note any required additional research

Focus on things that:
- Real bakeries deal with constantly
- Significantly affect outcomes
- Aren't currently represented

Examples might include: waste/spoilage, quality variation, customer demand fluctuation, equipment breakdowns, seasonal ingredient availability, etc.
```

### Step 6.2: Implement Priority Enhancements

Repeat research â synthesis â implementation â validation cycle for each enhancement:

1. Use Gemini Deep Research for specific additional information
2. Use Claude Pro to integrate into simulation
3. Use Claude Code to validate
4. Update documentation

**Continue until diminishing returns or time constraints**
